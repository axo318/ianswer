The development of MEMS devices that incorporate silicon-based cantilevers, microgears or diaphragms, for example, has required innovations of the traditional fabrication techniques employed for integrated circuit manufacturing.  BioMEMS technology has evolved from such developments, and has been driven by the promise of low-cost medical diagnostic and drug delivery devices, as well as new research tools for high-throughput drug screening, proteomics and genomics, for example.

Most BioMEMS devices incorporate the processing of fluid volumes.  The characteristic dimensions (channel width and depth) of microfluidic systems are typically less than 100 micron.  The fluid flow resistance of such small channels is dominated by the fluid viscosity.  The surface-area-to-volume ratio increases as these length scales get smaller, and this leads to advantages over conventional macroscopic fluidics as well as to some challenges (see figure 1).  Advantages include small reagent volumes that can be controlled accurately and quickly, but an appropriate account of the surface physics of the device materials (silicon, glass, ceramic and polymer) requires critical attention.  Surfaces sometimes require modifications to accommodate biomedical assays, and biocompatibility and safety issues demanded by international regulatory bodies (e.g., the FDA in the USA) are also required.  These surface-related issues are often not straightforward.

New materials and techniques are being developed for reproducible molding, casting and bonding of BioMEMS devices intended for mass production in the medical disposable market.  The three-dimensional construction and integration of microelectronics with microfluidic reaction chambers and biosensors also require innovations beyond those required of conventional MEMS devices.  Simple microfluidic systems (and the control of fluid flow) are shown in figures 2 & 3, and examples of integrated lab-on-chip devices are shown in figures 4 & 5.

Diagnostics.  Sample preparation and analysis of blood and other biological fluids (urine, cerebral spinal fluids), extracted cells and tissues (see figure 6).
Drug Delivery. Implanted or transdermal ‘smart microsystems’ with automated sensing and assaying that control powered actuators for dispensing accurately titrated drugs from small reservoirs.  (Rather than passive medication through diffusion of drugs from hydrogels or transdermal patches).
Minimally Invasive Surgical Procedures.  In conjunction with endoscopic (fibre optic) techniques to target organs and tumours for drug delivery or the implantation of microsensors and microactuators. Personalized Medicine.  DNA and protein microarray chips to screen individuals for a predisposition to particular diseases and to help match a specific therapy to that individual.  An important aspect of this is SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) genotyping.  SNPs are small stretches of DNA that differ by only one base pair and uniquely distinguishes a person’s genetic makeup. Tissue Engineering. To aid nerve and tissue repair or replacement.  Examples include electroactive polymers with stimulating electrodes as muscle substitutes, and tissue-scaffolding devices.
