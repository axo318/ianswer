Photolithography and related processes are the workhorses of micro- and nano-technology (Figs.1 & 2).  Several developments are occurring simultaneously, namely: the drive to reduce minimum feature-size leading to advances in microelectronics; the use of photolith patterned structures to prepare devices for photonic, sensing, biotechnological and other applications; and the drive to create 3-D structures for new devices and materials development.

This controlled formation of nanometer-scale structures occurs through Top-Down or Bottom-Up fabrication approaches (or their combination).

The concept of a Top-Down approach to Nanotechnology is widely considered to have originated during a famous talk in 1959 by Nobel physicist Richard Feynman  (Fig.3).  In this talk, he offered a $1000 prize for the construction of a working electric motor no larger than a 400m-sided cube.  Eleven months later, the prize was awarded to William McLellan, for building a 250g, 2000 rpm motor of 13 separate parts, roughly the size of the full-stop at the end of this sentence.  In 1995, the Foresight Institute offered a $250,000 Feynman Grand Prize for the first programmable, nanometer-scale, robotic arm to be built.

According to Feynman’s top-down approach, an engineer would first direct a machine shop to fabricate an exact copy of itself, but four times smaller in size.  After verifying that all the machines (e.g., lathes, drills) operate properly, this reduced-scale machine shop would then be used to build a copy of itself, another factor of four smaller (i.e., 16-times smaller than the original machine shop).  This process of fabricating progressively smaller machine shops proceeds until a machine shop capable of operating at the nanoscale is produced (Fig.4).  The final result is a nanomachine shop capable of reconstructing itself, or of producing any other useful nanoscale product using molecular components.

Progress towards this ‘dream’ is being made in the new engineering field known as Micro Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS), which originally developed as an extension of the photolithography and etching techniques used to fabricate electronic ‘chips’, and not by micromanipulations in a miniature machine shop.  MEMS research has produced micro: -accelerometers, -sensors, -valves, -pistons, -pumps, -actuators, -mirrors, -shutters, and micro-gyroscopes.  Thus, MEMS devices can integrate mechanical components directly with electrical circuits to give the electronics immediate access to control applications.  In terms of system size, micromachined MEMS devices (typically ~10-13 m3 in volume) lie mid-way between the normal world (~10-4 m3) and the nanoscale world (~10-22 m3).

Biomimetics is the study of how Nature has developed manufacturing methods, materials, structures and intelligence.  The challenge is to learn the most important things that Nature can teach us, and to then apply that knowledge to further advance our technology.  Examples of successful biomimetics include artificial materials for medical implants, tissue engineering, and neural network software based on the human brain.  However, these devices are relatively large, and are fabricated by Top-Down methodologies.
