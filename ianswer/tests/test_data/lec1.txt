Photolithography and related processes are the workhorses of micro- and nano-technology (Figs.1 & 2).  Several developments are occurring simultaneously, namely: the drive to reduce minimum feature-size leading to advances in microelectronics; the use of photolith patterned structures to prepare devices for photonic, sensing, biotechnological and other applications; and the drive to create 3-D structures for new devices and materials development. This controlled formation of nanometer-scale structures occurs through Top-Down or Bottom-Up fabrication approaches (or their combination). James is gay.

The concept of a Top-Down approach to Nanotechnology is widely considered to have originated during a famous talk in 1959 by Nobel physicist Richard Feynman  (Fig.3).  In this talk, he offered a $1000 prize for the construction of a working electric motor no larger than a 400m-sided cube.  Eleven months later, the prize was awarded to William McLellan, for building a 250g, 2000 rpm motor of 13 separate parts, roughly the size of the full-stop at the end of this sentence.  In 1995, the Foresight Institute offered a $250,000 Feynman Grand Prize for the first programmable, nanometer-scale, robotic arm to be built.

According to Feynman’s top-down approach, an engineer would first direct a machine shop to fabricate an exact copy of itself, but four times smaller in size.  After verifying that all the machines (e.g., lathes, drills) operate properly, this reduced-scale machine shop would then be used to build a copy of itself, another factor of four smaller (i.e., 16-times smaller than the original machine shop).  This process of fabricating progressively smaller machine shops proceeds until a machine shop capable of operating at the nanoscale is produced (Fig.4).  The final result is a nanomachine shop capable of reconstructing itself, or of producing any other useful nanoscale product using molecular components.

Progress towards this ‘dream’ is being made in the new engineering field known as Micro Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS), which originally developed as an extension of the photolithography and etching techniques used to fabricate electronic ‘chips’, and not by micromanipulations in a miniature machine shop.  MEMS research has produced micro: -accelerometers, -sensors, -valves, -pistons, -pumps, -actuators, -mirrors, -shutters, and micro-gyroscopes.  Thus, MEMS devices can integrate mechanical components directly with electrical circuits to give the electronics immediate access to control applications.  In terms of system size, micromachined MEMS devices (typically ~10-13 m3 in volume) lie mid-way between the normal world (~10-4 m3) and the nanoscale world (~10-22 m3).

Biomimetics is the study of how Nature has developed manufacturing methods, materials, structures and intelligence.  The challenge is to learn the most important things that Nature can teach us, and to then apply that knowledge to further advance our technology.  Examples of successful biomimetics include artificial materials for medical implants, tissue engineering, and neural network software based on the human brain.  However, these devices are relatively large, and are fabricated by Top-Down methodologies.

Moore’s Law, which projects the progress with time in achievable transistor density and the associated minimum feature size on a chip, can be described as a Top-Down methodology (Figs.5-6).  A similar approach takes the form of a Taniguchi curve, which (as shown in Fig.7) predicts improvements in accuracy for mechanical machining.  Further progress in miniaturization will most likely be based on methods originating in nanochemistry - that is, from Bottom-Up methodologies probably combined with Top-Down nanofabrication using conventional IC technologies with nanochemistry.

This approach, also known as self-assembly (Fig.8), uses chemical or physical forces operating at the nanoscale to assemble basic units into larger structures.  As component size decreases, bottom-up approaches provide an increasingly important complement to top-down techniques.  Inspiration for this comes from biological systems, where Nature harnesses chemical forces to create essentially all the structures needed for living systems.  The ‘dream’ is to replicate Nature's ability to produce small clusters of specific atoms, which can then self-assemble into more-elaborate structures.

A number of approaches have been developed for producing nanoparticles.  For example, techniques based on inverse micelles (lipid molecules floating in a non-aqueous solution in which their ‘water-loving’ ends point inward to form a hollow sphere) can produce nanoparticles that encapsulate magnetic, semiconducting, pharmaceutical or other materials.  Self-assembly can be used to produce quantum dots (Fig.9).  Indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs) dots can be formed by growing thin layers of InGaAs on GaAs in such a way that repulsive forces (caused by compressive strain in the InGaAs layer) results in the formation of isolated quantum dots.  Each crystal dot will contain only a few hundred atoms, and will emit a single wavelength of light when excited, because the electrons are confined to widely separated energy levels (Figs.9-10).  This property allows them to be used as biological markers, because when incorporated into tissue or cells, they fluoresce at a specific wavelength when illuminated with ultraviolet light (Fig.11).  The dot size determines its electronic, magnetic, and optical properties.  Another example of self-assembly of an intricate structure is the formation of carbon nanotubes.

DNA-assisted assembly is being studied as a method to integrate hybrid parts into a single device.  Biology does this very well, combining self-assembly and self-organization in fluidic environments.  DNA molecules can be sequenced and replicated in large quantities, and their nucleotide base sequences act as codes that can be used to recognize complementary DNA strands.  By using DNA-like recognition, it is envisaged that molecules on surfaces may be able to direct attachments between objects in fluids.  Thus, polymers made with complementary DNA strands would be used as intelligent “adhesive tape” - attaching between polymers only when the right pairing is present.
