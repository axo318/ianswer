hat Bob will measure −1 on his qubit if he also measures spin along the ⃗v axis. Similarly, if Alice measured −1, then she can predict with certainty that Bob will measure +1 on his qubit. Because it is always possible for Alice to predict the value of the measurement result recorded when Bob’s qubit is measured in the ⃗v direction, that physical property must correspond to an element of reality, by the EPR criterion, and should be repre- sented in any complete physical theory. 

However, standard quantum mechanics, as we have presented it, merely tells one how to calculate the probabilities of the respective measurement outcomes if v · ⃗σ is measured. Standard quantum mechanics certainly does not include any fundamental element intended to represent the value of v σ, for all unit vectorsv.

The goal of EPR was to show that quantum mechanics is incomplete, by demonstrating that quantum mechanics lacked some essential ‘element of reality’, by their criterion. They hoped to force a return to a more classical view of the world, one in which systems could be ascribed properties which existed independently of measurements performed on those systems. Unfortunately for EPR, most physicists did not accept the above reasoning as convincing. The attempt to impose on Nature by fiat properties which she must obey seems a most peculiar way of studying her laws.

Indeed, Nature has had the last laugh on EPR. Nearly thirty years after the EPR paper was published, an experimental test was proposed that could be used to check whether or not the picture of the world which EPR were hoping to force a return to is valid or not. It turns out that Nature experimentally invalidates that point of view, while agreeing with quantum mechanics.

The key to this experimental invalidation is a result known as Bell’s inequality. Bell’s inequality is not a result about quantum mechanics, so the first thing we need to do is momentarily forget all our knowledge of quantum mechanics. To obtain Bell’s inequality, we’re going to do a thought experiment, which we will analyze using our common sense notions of how the world works – the sort of notions Einstein and his collaborators thought Nature ought to obey. After we have done the common sense analysis, we will perform a quantum mechanical analysis which we can show is not consistent with the common sense analysis. Nature can then be asked, by means of a real experiment, to decide between our common sense notions of how the world works, and quantum mechanics.

Imagine we perform the following experiment, illustrated in Figure 2.4. Charlie pre- pares two particles. It doesn’t matter how he prepares the particles, just that he is capable of repeating the experimental procedure which he uses. Once he has performed the prepa- ration, he sends one particle to Alice, and the second particle to Bob.

Once Alice receives her particle, she performs a measurement on it. Imagine that she has available two different measurement apparatuses, so she could choose to do one of two different measurements. These measurements are of physical properties which we shall label PQ and PR, respectively. Alice doesn’t know in advance which measurement she will choose to perform. Rather, when she receives the particle she flips a coin or uses some other random method to decide which measurement to perform. We suppose for simplicity that the measurements can each have one of two outcomes, +1 or −1. 

Suppose Alice’s particle has a value Q for the property PQ. Q is assumed to be an objective property of Alice’s particle, which is merely revealed by the measurement, much as we imagine the position of a tennis ball to be revealed by the particles of light being scattered off it. Similarly, let R denote the value revealed by a measurement of the property PR.

Similarly, suppose that Bob is capable of measuring one of two properties, PS or PT , once again revealing an objectively existing value S or T for the property, each taking value +1 or −1. Bob does not decide beforehand which property he will measure, but waits until he has received the particle and then chooses randomly. The timing of the experiment is arranged so that Alice and Bob do their measurements at the same time (or, to use the more precise language of relativity, in a causally disconnected manner). Therefore, the measurement which Alice performs cannot disturb the result of Bob’s measurement (or vice versa), since physical influences cannot propagate faster than light.

Figure 2.4. Schematic experimental setup for the Bell inequalities. Alice can choose to measure either Q or R, and Bob chooses to measure either S or T . They perform their measurements simultaneously. Alice and Bob are assumed to be far enough apart that performing a measurement on one system can not have any effect on the result of measurements on the other.
