Linear algebra is the study of vector spaces and of linear operations on those vector
spaces. A good understanding of quantum mechanics is based upon a solid grasp of
elementary linear algebra. In this section we review some basic concepts from linear
algebra, and describe the standard notations which are used for these concepts in the
study of quantum mechanics. These notations are summarized in Figure 2.1 on page 62,
with the quantum notation in the left column, and the linear-algebraic description in the
right column. You may like to glance at the table, and see how many of the concepts in
the right column you recognize.
In our opinion the chief obstacle to assimilation of the postulates of quantum mechanics is not the postulates themselves, but rather the large body of linear algebraic notions
required to understand them. Coupled with the unusual Dirac notation adopted by physicists for quantum mechanics, it can appear (falsely) quite fearsome. For these reasons,
we advise the reader not familiar with quantum mechanics to quickly read through the
material which follows, pausing mainly to concentrate on understanding the absolute basics of the notation being used. Then proceed to a careful study of the main topic of the
chapter ‚Äì the postulates of quantum mechanics ‚Äì returning to study the necessary linear
algebraic notions and notations in more depth, as required.
The basic objects of linear algebra are vector spaces. The vector space of most interest
to us is Cn , the space of all n-tuples of complex numbers, (z1 , . . . , zn ). The elements of
a vector space are called vectors, and we will sometimes use the column matrix notation

to indicate a vector. There is an addition operation deÔ¨Åned which takes pairs of vectors
to other vectors. In Cn the addition operation for vectors is deÔ¨Åned by

Introduction to quantum mechanics

where z is a scalar, that is, a complex number, and the multiplications on the right
are ordinary multiplication of complex numbers. Physicists sometimes refer to complex
numbers as c-numbers.
Quantum mechanics is our main motivation for studying linear algebra, so we will use
the standard notation of quantum mechanics for linear algebraic concepts. The standard
quantum mechanical notation for a vector in a vector space is the following:
|œà.

(2.4)

œà is a label for the vector (any label is valid, although we prefer to use simple labels like
œà and œï). The |¬∑ notation is used to indicate that the object is a vector. The entire object
|œà is sometimes called a ket, although we won‚Äôt use that terminology often.
A vector space also contains a special zero vector, which we denote by 0. It satisÔ¨Åes
the property that for any other vector |v, |v + 0 = |v. Note that we do not use the
ket notation for the zero vector ‚Äì it is the only exception we shall make. The reason
for making the exception is because it is conventional to use the ‚Äòobvious‚Äô notation for
the zero vector, |0, to mean something else entirely. The scalar multiplication operation
is such that z0 = 0 for any complex number z. For convenience, we use the notation
(z1 , . . . , zn ) to denote a column matrix with entries z1 , . . . , zn . In Cn the zero element
is (0, 0, . . . , 0). A vector subspace of a vector space V is a subset W of V such that W is
also a vector space, that is, W must be closed under scalar multiplication and addition.

2.1.1 Bases and linear independence
A spanning set for a vector space is a set of vectors |v1 , . . . , |vn  such that any vector

|v in the vector space can be written as a linear combination |v = i ai |vi  of vectors

in C2 can be written as a linear combination |v = a1 |v1  + a2 |v2  of the vectors |v1  and
|v2 . We say that the vectors |v1  and |v2  span the vector space C2 .
Generally, a vector space may have many different spanning sets. A second spanning
set for the vector space C2 is the set

A set of non-zero vectors |v1 , . . . , |vn  are linearly dependent if there exists a set of
complex numbers a1 , . . . , an with ai = 0 for at least one value of i, such that
a1 |v1  + a2 |v2  + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + an |vn  = 0.

(2.9)

A set of vectors is linearly independent if it is not linearly dependent. It can be shown
that any two sets of linearly independent vectors which span a vector space V contain the
same number of elements. We call such a set a basis for V . Furthermore, such a basis
set always exists. The number of elements in the basis is deÔ¨Åned to be the dimension of
V . In this book we will only be interested in Ô¨Ånite dimensional vector spaces. There are
many interesting and often difÔ¨Åcult questions associated with inÔ¨Ånite dimensional vector
spaces. We won‚Äôt need to worry about these questions.
Exercise 2.1: (Linear dependence: example) Show that (1, ‚àí1), (1, 2) and (2, 1)
are linearly dependent.
2.1.2 Linear operators and matrices
A linear operator between vector spaces V and W is deÔ¨Åned to be any function A :
V ‚Üí W which is linear in its inputs,

Usually we just write A|v to denote A(|v). When we say that a linear operator A is
deÔ¨Åned on a vector space, V , we mean that A is a linear operator from V to V . An
important linear operator on any vector space V is the identity operator, IV , deÔ¨Åned by
the equation IV |v ‚â° |v for all vectors |v. Where no chance of confusion arises we drop
the subscript V and just write I to denote the identity operator. Another important linear
operator is the zero operator, which we denote 0. The zero operator maps all vectors to

64

Introduction to quantum mechanics

the zero vector, 0|v ‚â° 0. It is clear from (2.10) that once the action of a linear operator
A on a basis is speciÔ¨Åed, the action of A is completely determined on all inputs.
Suppose V, W , and X are vector spaces, and A : V ‚Üí W and B : W ‚Üí X are
linear operators. Then we use the notation BA to denote the composition of B with A,
deÔ¨Åned by (BA)(|v) ‚â° B(A(|v)). Once again, we write BA|v as an abbreviation for
(BA)(|v).
The most convenient way to understand linear operators is in terms of their matrix
representations. In fact, the linear operator and matrix viewpoints turn out to be completely equivalent. The matrix viewpoint may be more familiar to you, however. To see
the connection, it helps to Ô¨Årst understand that an m by n complex matrix A with entries
Aij is in fact a linear operator sending vectors in the vector space Cn to the vector space
Cm , under matrix multiplication of the matrix A by a vector in Cn . More precisely, the
claim that the matrix A is a linear operator just means that


A

ai |vi 

(2.11)

i

is true as an equation where the operation is matrix multiplication of A by column vectors.
Clearly, this is true!
We‚Äôve seen that matrices can be regarded as linear operators. Can linear operators
be given a matrix representation? In fact they can, as we now explain. This equivalence
between the two viewpoints justiÔ¨Åes our interchanging terms from matrix theory and
operator theory throughout the book. Suppose A : V ‚Üí W is a linear operator between
vector spaces V and W . Suppose |v1 , . . . , |vm  is a basis for V and |w1 , . . . , |wn  is a
basis for W . Then for each j in the range 1, . . . , m, there exist complex numbers A1j
through Anj such that
A|vj  =

Aij |wi .

(2.12)

i

The matrix whose entries are the values Aij is said to form a matrix representation of the
operator A. This matrix representation of A is completely equivalent to the operator A,
and we will use the matrix representation and abstract operator viewpoints interchangeably. Note that to make the connection between matrices and linear operators we must
specify a set of input and output basis states for the input and output vector spaces of
the linear operator.
Exercise 2.2: (Matrix representations: example) Suppose V is a vector space
with basis vectors |0 and |1, and A is a linear operator from V to V such that
A|0 = |1 and A|1 = |0. Give a matrix representation for A, with respect to
the input basis |0, |1, and the output basis |0, |1. Find input and output bases
which give rise to a different matrix representation of A.
Exercise 2.3: (Matrix representation for operator products) Suppose A is a
linear operator from vector space V to vector space W , and B is a linear
operator from vector space W to vector space X. Let |vi , |wj , and |xk  be
bases for the vector spaces V, W , and X, respectively. Show that the matrix
representation for the linear transformation BA is the matrix product of the
matrix representations for B and A, with respect to the appropriate bases.

Exercise 2.4: (Matrix representation for identity) Show that the identity operator
on a vector space V has a matrix representation which is one along the diagonal
and zero everywhere else, if the matrix representation is taken with respect to the
same input and output bases. This matrix is known as the identity matrix.
2.1.3 The Pauli matrices
Four extremely useful matrices which we shall often have occasion to use are the Pauli
matrices. These are 2 by 2 matrices, which go by a variety of notations. The matrices,
and their corresponding notations, are depicted in Figure 2.2. The Pauli matrices are so
useful in the study of quantum computation and quantum information that we encourage
you to memorize them by working through in detail the many examples and exercises
based upon them in subsequent sections.

2.1.4 Inner products
An inner product is a function which takes as input two vectors |v and |w from a vector
space and produces a complex number as output. For the time being, it will be convenient
to write the inner product of |v and |w as (|v, |w). This is not the standard quantum
mechanical notation; for pedagogical clarity the (¬∑, ¬∑) notation will be useful occasionally in
this chapter. The standard quantum mechanical notation for the inner product (|v, |w)
is v|w, where |v and |w are vectors in the inner product space, and the notation v|
is used for the dual vector to the vector |v; the dual is a linear operator from the inner
product space V to the complex numbers C, deÔ¨Åned by v|(|w) ‚â° v|w ‚â° (|v, |w).
We will see shortly that the matrix representation of dual vectors is just a row vector.
A function (¬∑, ¬∑) from V √ó V to C is an inner product if it satisÔ¨Åes the requirements
that:
(1) (¬∑, ¬∑) is linear in the second argument,

Discussions of quantum mechanics often refer to Hilbert space. In the Ô¨Ånite dimensional complex vector spaces that come up in quantum computation and quantum information, a Hilbert space is exactly the same thing as an inner product space. From now
on we use the two terms interchangeably, preferring the term Hilbert space. In inÔ¨Ånite
dimensions Hilbert spaces satisfy additional technical restrictions above and beyond inner
product spaces, which we will not need to worry about.
Vectors |w and |v are orthogonal if their inner product is zero. For example, |w ‚â°
(1, 0) and |v ‚â° (0, 1) are orthogonal with respect to the inner product deÔ¨Åned by (2.14).
We deÔ¨Åne the norm of a vector |v by

(2.16)
|v ‚â° v|v .
A unit vector is a vector |v such that |v = 1. We also say that |v is normalized if
|v = 1. It is convenient to talk of normalizing a vector by dividing by its norm; thus
|v/|v is the normalized form of |v, for any non-zero vector |v. A set |i of vectors
with index i is orthonormal if each vector is a unit vector, and distinct vectors in the set
are orthogonal, that is, i|j = Œ¥ij , where i and j are both chosen from the index set.
Exercise 2.7: Verify that |w ‚â° (1, 1) and |v ‚â° (1, ‚àí1) are orthogonal. What are the
normalized forms of these vectors?
Suppose |w1 , . . . , |wd  is a basis set for some vector space V with an inner product.
There is a useful method, the Gram‚ÄìSchmidt procedure, which can be used to produce an
orthonormal basis set |v1 , . . . , |vd  for the vector space V . DeÔ¨Åne |v1  ‚â° |w1 / |w1  ,
and for 1 ‚â§ k ‚â§ d ‚àí 1 deÔ¨Åne |vk+1  inductively by

|wk+1  ‚àí ki=1 vi |wk+1 |vi 
|vk+1  ‚â°
.
(2.17)

|wk+1  ‚àí ki=1 vi |wk+1 |vi 
It is not difÔ¨Åcult to verify that the vectors |v1 , . . . , |vd  form an orthonormal set which
is also a basis for V . Thus, any Ô¨Ånite dimensional vector space of dimension d has an
orthonormal basis, |v1 , . . . , |vd .
Exercise 2.8: Prove that the Gram‚ÄìSchmidt procedure produces an orthonormal basis
for V .
From now on, when we speak of a matrix representation for a linear operator, we mean
a matrix representation with respect to orthonormal input and output bases. We also use
the convention that if the input and output spaces for a linear operator are the same, then
the input and output bases are the same, unless noted otherwise.

Linear algebra

With these conventions, the inner product on a Hilbert space can be given a convenient


matrix representation. Let |w = i wi |i and |v = j vj |j be representations of
vectors |w and |v with respect to some orthonormal basis |i. Then, since i|j = Œ¥ij ,

That is, the inner product of two vectors is equal to the vector inner product between
two matrix representations of those vectors, provided the representations are written
with respect to the same orthonormal basis. We also see that the dual vector v| has a
nice interpretation as the row vector whose components are complex conjugates of the
corresponding components of the column vector representation of |v.
There is a useful way of representing linear operators which makes use of the inner
product, known as the outer product representation. Suppose |v is a vector in an inner
product space V , and |w is a vector in an inner product space W . DeÔ¨Åne |wv| to be
the linear operator from V to W whose action is deÔ¨Åned by
|wv|

|v   ‚â° |w v|v   = v|v  |w.

(2.20)

This equation Ô¨Åts beautifully into our notational conventions, according to which the
expression |wv|v   could potentially have one of two meanings: we will use it to denote
the result when the operator |wv| acts on |v  , and it has an existing interpretation as
the result of multiplying |w by the complex number v|v  . Our deÔ¨Ånitions are chosen
so that these two potential meanings coincide. Indeed, we deÔ¨Åne the former in terms of
the latter!
We can take linear combinations of outer product operators |wv| in the obvious way.

By deÔ¨Ånition i ai |wi vi | is the linear operator which, when acting on |v  , produces


i ai |wi vi |v  as output.
The usefulness of the outer product notation can be discerned from an important result
known as the completeness relation for orthonormal vectors. Let |i be any orthonormal

basis for the vector space V , so an arbitrary vector |v can be written |v = i vi |i for
some set of complex numbers vi . Note that i|v = vi and therefore


|ii| |v =

|ii|v =

i

i

vi |i = |v.

(2.21)

i

Since the last equation is true for all |v it follows that
|ii| = I.

(2.22)

i

This equation is known as the completeness relation. One application of the completeness
relation is to give a means for representing any operator in the outer product notation.
Suppose A : V ‚Üí W is a linear operator, |vi  is an orthonormal basis for V , and |wj 
an orthonormal basis for W . Using the completeness relation twice we obtain
A = IW AIV

which is the outer product representation for A. We also see from this equation that A
has matrix element wj |A|vi  in the ith column and jth row, with respect to the input
basis |vi  and output basis |wj .
A second application illustrating the usefulness of the completeness relation is the
Cauchy‚ÄìSchwarz inequality. This important result is discussed in Box 2.1, on this
page.
Exercise 2.9: (Pauli operators and the outer product) The Pauli matrices
(Figure 2.2 on page 65) can be considered as operators with respect to an
orthonormal basis |0, |1 for a two-dimensional Hilbert space. Express each of
the Pauli operators in the outer product notation.
Exercise 2.10: Suppose |vi  is an orthonormal basis for an inner product space V .
What is the matrix representation for the operator |vj vk |, with respect to the
|vi  basis?

Box 2.1: The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality
The Cauchy‚ÄìSchwarz inequality is an important geometric fact about Hilbert
spaces. It states that for any two vectors |v and |w, |v|w|2 ‚â§ v|vw|w. To
see this, use the Gram‚ÄìSchmidt procedure to construct an orthonormalbasis |i
for the vector space such that the Ô¨Årst member of the basis |i is |w/ w|w.

Using the completeness relation i |ii| = I, and dropping some non-negative
terms gives
v|vw|w =

as required. A little thought shows that equality occurs if and only if |v and |w
are linearly related, |v = z|w or |w = z|v, for some scalar z.

2.1.5 Eigenvectors and eigenvalues
An eigenvector of a linear operator A on a vector space is a non-zero vector |v such that
A|v = v|v, where v is a complex number known as the eigenvalue of A corresponding
to |v. It will often be convenient to use the notation v both as a label for the eigenvector,
and to represent the eigenvalue. We assume that you are familiar with the elementary
properties of eigenvalues and eigenvectors ‚Äì in particular, how to Ô¨Ånd them, via the
characteristic equation. The characteristic function is deÔ¨Åned to be c(Œª) ‚â° det |A ‚àí ŒªI|,

Linear algebra

69

where det is the determinant function for matrices; it can be shown that the characteristic
function depends only upon the operator A, and not on the speciÔ¨Åc matrix representation
used for A. The solutions of the characteristic equation c(Œª) = 0 are the eigenvalues
of the operator A. By the fundamental theorem of algebra, every polynomial has at least
one complex root, so every operator A has at least one eigenvalue, and a corresponding
eigenvector. The eigenspace corresponding to an eigenvalue v is the set of vectors which
have eigenvalue v. It is a vector subspace of the vector space on which A acts.
A diagonal representation for an operator A on a vector space V is a representation

A = i Œªi |ii|, where the vectors |i form an orthonormal set of eigenvectors for A,
with corresponding eigenvalues Œªi . An operator is said to be diagonalizable if it has a
diagonal representation. In the next section we will Ô¨Ånd a simple set of necessary and
sufÔ¨Åcient conditions for an operator on a Hilbert space to be diagonalizable. As an example
of a diagonal representation, note that the Pauli Z matrix may be written


1
0
Z=
= |00| ‚àí |11|,
(2.29)
0 ‚àí1
where the matrix representation is with respect to orthonormal vectors |0 and |1, respectively. Diagonal representations are sometimes also known as orthonormal decompositions.
When an eigenspace is more than one dimensional we say that it is degenerate. For
example, the matrix A deÔ¨Åned by
‚é°
‚é§
2 0 0
A‚â°‚é£ 0 2 0 ‚é¶
(2.30)
0 0 0
has a two-dimensional eigenspace corresponding to the eigenvalue 2. The eigenvectors
(1, 0, 0) and (0, 1, 0) are said to be degenerate because they are linearly independent
eigenvectors of A with the same eigenvalue.
Exercise 2.11: (Eigendecomposition of the Pauli matrices) Find the
eigenvectors, eigenvalues, and diagonal representations of the Pauli matrices
X, Y , and Z.
Exercise 2.12: Prove that the matrix

is not diagonalizable.
2.1.6 Adjoints and Hermitian operators
Suppose A is any linear operator on a Hilbert space, V . It turns out that there exists a
unique linear operator A‚Ä† on V such that for all vectors |v, |w ‚àà V ,
(|v, A|w) = (A‚Ä† |v, |w).

(2.32)

This linear operator is known as the adjoint or Hermitian conjugate of the operator
A. From the deÔ¨Ånition it is easy to see that (AB)‚Ä† = B ‚Ä† A‚Ä† . By convention, if |v is
a vector, then we deÔ¨Åne |v‚Ä† ‚â° v|. With this deÔ¨Ånition it is not difÔ¨Åcult to see that
(A|v)‚Ä† = v|A‚Ä† .

An operator A whose adjoint is A is known as a Hermitian or self-adjoint operator. An important class of Hermitian operators is the projectors. Suppose W is a
k-dimensional vector subspace of the d-dimensional vector space V . Using the Gram‚Äì
Schmidt procedure it is possible to construct an orthonormal basis |1, . . . , |d for V
such that |1, . . . , |k is an orthonormal basis for W . By deÔ¨Ånition,
k

P ‚â°

(2.35)

i=1

is the projector onto the subspace W . It is easy to check that this deÔ¨Ånition is independent
of the orthonormal basis |1, . . . , |k used for W . From the deÔ¨Ånition it can be shown that
|vv| is Hermitian for any vector |v, so P is Hermitian, P ‚Ä† = P . We will often refer
to the ‚Äòvector space‚Äô P , as shorthand for the vector space onto which P is a projector.
The orthogonal complement of P is the operator Q ‚â° I ‚àí P . It is easy to see that Q is
a projector onto the vector space spanned by |k + 1, . . . , |d, which we also refer to as
the orthogonal complement of P , and may denote by Q.
Exercise 2.16: Show that any projector P satisÔ¨Åes the equation P 2 = P .
An operator A is said to be normal if AA‚Ä† = A‚Ä† A. Clearly, an operator which
is Hermitian is also normal. There is a remarkable representation theorem for normal
operators known as the spectral decomposition, which states that an operator is a normal
operator if and only if it is diagonalizable. This result is proved in Box 2.2 on page 72,
which you should read closely.
Exercise 2.17: Show that a normal matrix is Hermitian if and only if it has real
eigenvalues.
A matrix U is said to be unitary if U ‚Ä† U = I. Similarly an operator U is unitary if
U ‚Ä†U = I. It is easily checked that an operator is unitary if and only if each of its matrix
representations is unitary. A unitary operator also satisÔ¨Åes U U ‚Ä† = I, and therefore U is
normal and has a spectral decomposition. Geometrically, unitary operators are important
because they preserve inner products between vectors. To see this, let |v and |w be any

Linear algebra

71

two vectors. Then the inner product of U |v and U |w is the same as the inner product
of |v and |w,
U |v, U |w = v|U ‚Ä† U |w = v|I|w = v|w.

(2.36)

This result suggests the following elegant outer product representation of any unitary U .
Let |vi  be any orthonormal basis set. DeÔ¨Åne |wi  ‚â° U |vi , so |wi  is also an orthonormal

basis set, since unitary operators preserve inner products. Note that U = i |wi vi |.
Conversely, if |vi  and |wi  are any two orthonormal bases, then it is easily checked that

the operator U deÔ¨Åned by U ‚â° i |wi vi | is a unitary operator.
Exercise 2.18: Show that all eigenvalues of a unitary matrix have modulus 1, that is,
can be written in the form eiŒ∏ for some real Œ∏.
Exercise 2.19: (Pauli matrices: Hermitian and unitary) Show that the Pauli
matrices are Hermitian and unitary.
Exercise 2.20: (Basis changes) Suppose A and A are matrix representations of an
operator A on a vector space V with respect to two different orthonormal bases,
|vi  and |wi . Then the elements of A and A are Aij = vi |A|vj  and
Aij = wi |A|wj . Characterize the relationship between A and A .
A special subclass of Hermitian operators is extremely important. This is the positive
operators. A positive operator A is deÔ¨Åned to be an operator such that for any vector |v,
(|v, A|v) is a real, non-negative number. If (|v, A|v) is strictly greater than zero for
all |v = 0 then we say that A is positive deÔ¨Ånite. In Exercise 2.24 on this page you will
show that any positive operator is automatically Hermitian, and therefore by the spectral

decomposition has diagonal representation i Œªi |ii|, with non-negative eigenvalues Œªi .
Exercise 2.21: Repeat the proof of the spectral decomposition in Box 2.2 for the case
when M is Hermitian, simplifying the proof wherever possible.
Exercise 2.22: Prove that two eigenvectors of a Hermitian operator with different
eigenvalues are necessarily orthogonal.
Exercise 2.23: Show that the eigenvalues of a projector P are all either 0 or 1.
Exercise 2.24: (Hermiticity of positive operators) Show that a positive operator
is necessarily Hermitian. (Hint: Show that an arbitrary operator A can be
written A = B + iC where B and C are Hermitian.)
Exercise 2.25: Show that for any operator A, A‚Ä† A is positive.
2.1.7 Tensor products
The tensor product is a way of putting vector spaces together to form larger vector spaces.
This construction is crucial to understanding the quantum mechanics of multiparticle
systems. The following discussion is a little abstract, and may be difÔ¨Åcult to follow if
you‚Äôre not already familiar with the tensor product, so feel free to skip ahead now and
revisit later when you come to the discussion of tensor products in quantum mechanics.
Suppose V and W are vector spaces of dimension m and n respectively. For convenience we also suppose that V and W are Hilbert spaces. Then V ‚äó W (read ‚ÄòV tensor

Introduction to quantum mechanics

Box 2.2: The spectral decomposition ‚Äì important!
The spectral decomposition is an extremely useful representation theorem for normal operators.
Theorem 2.1: (Spectral decomposition) Any normal operator M on a vector
space V is diagonal with respect to some orthonormal basis for V .
Conversely, any diagonalizable operator is normal.
Proof
The converse is a simple exercise, so we prove merely the forward implication,
by induction on the dimension d of V . The case d = 1 is trivial. Let Œª be an
eigenvalue of M , P the projector onto the Œª eigenspace, and Q the projector onto
the orthogonal complement. Then M = (P + Q)M (P + Q) = P M P + QM P +
P M Q + QM Q. Obviously P M P = ŒªP . Furthermore, QM P = 0, as M takes
the subspace P into itself. We claim that P M Q = 0 also. To see this, let |v
be an element of the subspace P . Then M M ‚Ä†|v = M ‚Ä†M |v = ŒªM ‚Ä† |v. Thus,
M ‚Ä†|v has eigenvalue Œª and therefore is an element of the subspace P . It follows
that QM ‚Ä† P = 0. Taking the adjoint of this equation gives P M Q = 0. Thus
M = P M P + QM Q. Next, we prove that QM Q is normal. To see this, note that
QM = QM (P + Q) = QM Q, and QM ‚Ä† = QM ‚Ä† (P + Q) = QM ‚Ä†Q. Therefore,
by the normality of M , and the observation that Q2 = Q,
QM Q QM ‚Ä†Q = QM QM ‚Ä†Q
‚Ä†

= QM M Q
‚Ä†

= QM M Q
‚Ä†

= QM QM Q
‚Ä†

= QM Q QM Q ,

(2.37)
(2.38)
(2.39)
(2.40)
(2.41)

so QM Q is normal. By induction, QM Q is diagonal with respect to some orthonormal basis for the subspace Q, and P M P is already diagonal with respect
to some orthonormal basis for P . It follows that M = P M P + QM Q is diagonal
with respect to some orthonormal basis for the total vector space.
In terms of the outer product representation, this means that M can be written as

M = i Œªi |ii|, where Œªi are the eigenvalues of M , |i is an orthonormal basis
for V , and each |i an eigenvector of M with eigenvalue Œªi . In terms of projectors,

M = i Œªi Pi , where Œªi are again the eigenvalues of M , and Pi is the projector
onto the Œªi eigenspace of M . These projectors satisfy the completeness relation

i Pi = I, and the orthonormality relation Pi Pj = Œ¥ij Pi .

W ‚Äô) is an mn dimensional vector space. The elements of V ‚äó W are linear combinations
of ‚Äòtensor products‚Äô |v ‚äó |w of elements |v of V and |w of W . In particular, if |i and
|j are orthonormal bases for the spaces V and W then |i ‚äó |j is a basis for V ‚äó W . We
often use the abbreviated notations |v|w, |v, w or even |vw for the tensor product

Linear algebra

|v ‚äó |w. For example, if V is a two-dimensional vector space with basis vectors |0 and
|1 then |0 ‚äó |0 + |1 ‚äó |1 is an element of V ‚äó V .
By deÔ¨Ånition the tensor product satisÔ¨Åes the following basic properties:
(1) For an arbitrary scalar z and elements |v of V and |w of W ,
z |v ‚äó |w = z|v ‚äó |w = |v ‚äó z|w .

(2.42)

(2) For arbitrary |v1  and |v2  in V and |w in W ,
|v1  + |v2  ‚äó |w = |v1  ‚äó |w + |v2  ‚äó |w.

(2.43)

(3) For arbitrary |v in V and |w1  and |w2  in W ,
|v ‚äó |w1  + |w2  = |v ‚äó |w1  + |v ‚äó |w2 .

(2.44)

What sorts of linear operators act on the space V ‚äó W ? Suppose |v and |w are
vectors in V and W , and A and B are linear operators on V and W , respectively. Then
we can deÔ¨Åne a linear operator A ‚äó B on V ‚äó W by the equation
(A ‚äó B)(|v ‚äó |w) ‚â° A|v ‚äó B|w.

(2.45)

The deÔ¨Ånition of A ‚äó B is then extended to all elements of V ‚äó W in the natural way
to ensure linearity of A ‚äó B, that is,

It can be shown that A ‚äó B deÔ¨Åned in this way is a well-deÔ¨Åned linear operator on
V ‚äó W . This notion of the tensor product of two operators extends in the obvious way
to the case where A : V ‚Üí V  and B : W ‚Üí W  map between different vector spaces.
Indeed, an arbitrary linear operator C mapping V ‚äó W to V  ‚äó W  can be represented
as a linear combination of tensor products of operators mapping V to V  and W to W  ,

It can be shown that the function so deÔ¨Åned is a well-deÔ¨Åned inner product. From this
inner product, the inner product space V ‚äóW inherits the other structure we are familiar
with, such as notions of an adjoint, unitarity, normality, and Hermiticity.
All this discussion is rather abstract. It can be made much more concrete by moving

to a convenient matrix representation known as the Kronecker product. Suppose A is
an m by n matrix, and B is a p by q matrix. Then we have the matrix representation:

Finally, we mention the useful notation |œà‚äók , which means |œà tensored with itself k
times. For example |œà‚äó2 = |œà ‚äó |œà. An analogous notation is also used for operators
on tensor product spaces.

2.1.8 Operator functions
There are many important functions which can be deÔ¨Åned for operators and matrices. Generally speaking, given a function f from the complex numbers to the complex numbers, it is possible to deÔ¨Åne a corresponding matrix function on normal matrices (or some subclass, such as the Hermitian matrices) by the following construc
tion. Let A = a a|aa| be a spectral decomposition for a normal operator A. DeÔ¨Åne

f (A) ‚â° a f (a)|aa|. A little thought shows that f (A) is uniquely deÔ¨Åned. This procedure can be used, for example, to deÔ¨Åne the square root of a positive operator, the
logarithm of a positive-deÔ¨Ånite operator, or the exponential of a normal operator. As an
example,
 Œ∏


exp(Œ∏Z) =

since Z has eigenvectors |0 and |1.

Exercise 2.35: (Exponential of the Pauli matrices) Let v be any real,

where v ¬∑ œÉ ‚â°

3

i=1

(2.58)

vi œÉi . This exercise is generalized in Problem 2.1 on page 117.

Another important matrix function is the trace of a matrix. The trace of A is deÔ¨Åned
to be the sum of its diagonal elements,
tr(A) ‚â°

Aii .

(2.59)

i

The trace is easily seen to be cyclic, tr(AB) = tr(BA), and linear, tr(A + B) =
tr(A) + tr(B), tr(zA) = z tr(A), where A and B are arbitrary matrices, and z is a complex
number. Furthermore, from the cyclic property it follows that the trace of a matrix
is invariant under the unitary similarity transformation A ‚Üí U AU ‚Ä†, as tr(U AU ‚Ä†) =
tr(U ‚Ä† U A) = tr(A). In light of this result, it makes sense to deÔ¨Åne the trace of an operator
A to be the trace of any matrix representation of A. The invariance of the trace under
unitary similarity transformations ensures that the trace of an operator is well deÔ¨Åned.
As an example of the trace, suppose |œà is a unit vector and A is an arbitrary operator. To evaluate tr(A|œàœà|) use the Gram‚ÄìSchmidt procedure to extend |œà to an

76

Introduction to quantum mechanics

orthonormal basis |i which includes |œà as the Ô¨Årst element. Then we have
i|A|œàœà|i

tr(A|œàœà|) =

(2.60)

i

= œà|A|œà.

(2.61)

This result, that tr(A|œàœà|) = œà|A|œà is extremely useful in evaluating the trace of an
operator.
Exercise 2.36: Show that the Pauli matrices except for I have trace zero.
Exercise 2.37: (Cyclic property of the trace) If A and B are two linear operators
show that
tr(AB) = tr(BA).

(2.62)

Exercise 2.38: (Linearity of the trace) If A and B are two linear operators, show
that
tr(A + B) = tr(A) + tr(B)

(2.63)

and if z is an arbitrary complex number show that
tr(zA) = ztr(A).

(2.64)

Exercise 2.39: (The Hilbert‚ÄìSchmidt inner product on operators) The set LV
of linear operators on a Hilbert space V is obviously a vector space ‚Äì the sum of
two linear operators is a linear operator, zA is a linear operator if A is a linear
operator and z is a complex number, and there is a zero element 0. An important
additional result is that the vector space LV can be given a natural inner product
structure, turning it into a Hilbert space.
(1) Show that the function (¬∑, ¬∑) on LV √ó LV deÔ¨Åned by
(A, B) ‚â° tr(A‚Ä† B)

(2.65)

is an inner product function. This inner product is known as the
Hilbert‚ÄìSchmidt or trace inner product.
(2) If V has d dimensions show that LV has dimension d2 .
(3) Find an orthonormal basis of Hermitian matrices for the Hilbert space LV .
2.1.9 The commutator and anti-commutator
The commutator between two operators A and B is deÔ¨Åned to be
[A, B] ‚â° AB ‚àí BA.

(2.66)

If [A, B] = 0, that is, AB = BA, then we say A commutes with B. Similarly, the
anti-commutator of two operators A and B is deÔ¨Åned by
{A, B} ‚â° AB + BA;

(2.67)

we say A anti-commutes with B if {A, B} = 0. It turns out that many important properties of pairs of operators can be deduced from their commutator and anti-commutator.
Perhaps the most useful relation is the following connection between the commutator and
the property of being able to simultaneously diagonalize Hermitian operators A and B,

Linear algebra

77



that is, write A = i ai |ii|, B = i bi |ii|, where |i is some common orthonormal
set of eigenvectors for A and B.

Theorem 2.2: (Simultaneous diagonalization theorem) Suppose A and B are
Hermitian operators. Then [A, B] = 0 if and only if there exists an orthonormal
basis such that both A and B are diagonal with respect to that basis. We say that
A and B are simultaneously diagonalizable in this case.
This result connects the commutator of two operators, which is often easy to compute,
to the property of being simultaneously diagonalizable, which is a priori rather difÔ¨Åcult
to determine. As an example, consider that

(2.70)
so X and Y do not commute. You have already shown, in Exercise 2.11, that X and Y
do not have common eigenvectors, as we expect from the simultaneous diagonalization
theorem.
Proof
You can (and should!) easily verify that if A and B are diagonal in the same orthonormal
basis then [A, B] = 0. To show the converse, let |a, j be an orthonormal basis for the
eigenspace Va of A with eigenvalue a; the index j is used to label possible degeneracies.
Note that
AB|a, j = BA|a, j = aB|a, j,

(2.71)

and therefore B|a, j is an element of the eigenspace Va . Let Pa denote the projector
onto the space Va and deÔ¨Åne Ba ‚â° Pa BPa . It is easy to see that the restriction of Ba to
the space Va is Hermitian on Va , and therefore has a spectral decomposition in terms of
an orthonormal set of eigenvectors which span the space Va . Let‚Äôs call these eigenvectors
|a, b, k, where the indices a and b label the eigenvalues of A and Ba , and k is an extra
index to allow for the possibility of a degenerate Ba . Note that B|a, b, k is an element
of Va , so B|a, b, k = Pa B|a, b, k. Moreover we have Pa |a, b, k = |a, b, k, so
B|a, b, k = Pa BPa |a, b, k = b|a, b, k.

(2.72)

It follows that |a, b, k is an eigenvector of B with eigenvalue b, and therefore |a, b, k is
an orthonormal set of eigenvectors of both A and B, spanning the entire vector space on
which A and B are deÔ¨Åned. That is, A and B are simultaneously diagonalizable.
Exercise 2.40: (Commutation relations for the Pauli matrices) Verify the

2.1.10 The polar and singular value decompositions
The polar and singular value decompositions are useful ways of breaking linear operators
up into simpler parts. In particular, these decompositions allow us to break general linear
operators up into products of unitary operators and positive operators. While we don‚Äôt
understand the structure of general linear operators terribly well, we do understand
unitary operators and positive operators in quite some detail. The polar and singular
value decompositions allow us to apply this understanding to better understand general
linear operators.
Theorem 2.3: (Polar decomposition) Let A be a linear operator on a vector space V .
Then there exists unitary U and positive operators J and K such that
A = U J = KU,

(2.79)

where the unique
‚àö J and K satisfying these equations are
‚àöpositive operators
deÔ¨Åned by J ‚â° A‚Ä† A and K ‚â° AA‚Ä† . Moreover, if A is invertible then U is
unique.

Linear algebra

We call the expression A = U J the left polar decomposition of A, and A = KU the
right polar decomposition of A. Most often, we‚Äôll omit the ‚Äòright‚Äô or ‚Äòleft‚Äô nomenclature,
and use the term ‚Äòpolar decomposition‚Äô for both expressions, with context indicating
which is meant.

Consider for now only those i for which Œªi = 0. For those i deÔ¨Åne |ei  ‚â° |œài /Œªi , so
the |ei  are normalized. Moreover, they are orthogonal, since if i = j then ei |ej  =

J is unique, since multiplying A = U J on‚àöthe left by the adjoint equation A‚Ä† = JU ‚Ä†

Introduction to quantum mechanics

2.2 The postulates of quantum mechanics
All understanding begins with our not accepting the world as it appears.
‚Äì Alan Kay
The most incomprehensible thing about the world is that it is comprehensible.
‚Äì Albert Einstein

Quantum mechanics is a mathematical framework for the development of physical theories. On its own quantum mechanics doesn‚Äôt tell you what laws a physical system must
obey, but it does provide a mathematical and conceptual framework for the development
of such laws. In the next few sections we give a complete description of the basic postulates of quantum mechanics. These postulates provide a connection between the physical
world and the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics.
The postulates of quantum mechanics were derived after a long process of trial and
(mostly) error, which involved a considerable amount of guessing and fumbling by the
originators of the theory. Don‚Äôt be surprised if the motivation for the postulates is not
always clear; even to experts the basic postulates of quantum mechanics appear surprising.
What you should expect to gain in the next few sections is a good working grasp of the
postulates ‚Äì how to apply them, and when.
2.2.1 State space
The Ô¨Årst postulate of quantum mechanics sets up the arena in which quantum mechanics
takes place. The arena is our familiar friend from linear algebra, Hilbert space.
Postulate 1: Associated to any isolated physical system is a complex vector space
with inner product (that is, a Hilbert space) known as the state space of the
system. The system is completely described by its state vector, which is a unit
vector in the system‚Äôs state space.
Quantum mechanics does not tell us, for a given physical system, what the state space
of that system is, nor does it tell us what the state vector of the system is. Figuring that
out for a speciÔ¨Åc system is a difÔ¨Åcult problem for which physicists have developed many
intricate and beautiful rules. For example, there is the wonderful theory of quantum
electrodynamics (often known as QED), which describes how atoms and light interact.
One aspect of QED is that it tells us what state spaces to use to give quantum descriptions
of atoms and light. We won‚Äôt be much concerned with the intricacies of theories like QED
(except in so far as they apply to physical realizations, in Chapter 7), as we are mostly
interested in the general framework provided by quantum mechanics. For our purposes
it will be sufÔ¨Åcient to make some very simple (and reasonable) assumptions about the
state spaces of the systems we are interested in, and stick with those assumptions.
The simplest quantum mechanical system, and the system which we will be most
concerned with, is the qubit. A qubit has a two-dimensional state space. Suppose |0 and
|1 form an orthonormal basis for that state space. Then an arbitrary state vector in the
state space can be written
|œà = a|0 + b|1,

(2.82)

The postulates of quantum mechanics

81

where a and b are complex numbers. The condition that |œà be a unit vector, œà|œà = 1,
is therefore equivalent to |a|2 + |b|2 = 1. The condition œà|œà = 1 is often known as the
normalization condition for state vectors.
We will take the qubit as our fundamental quantum mechanical system. Later, in
Chapter 7, we will see that there are real physical systems which may be described in
terms of qubits. For now, though, it is sufÔ¨Åcient to think of qubits in abstract terms,
without reference to a speciÔ¨Åc realization. Our discussions of qubits will always be referred
to some orthonormal set of basis vectors, |0 and |1, which should be thought of as being
Ô¨Åxed in advance. Intuitively, the states |0 and |1 are analogous to the two values 0 and
1 which a bit may take. The way a qubit differs from a bit is that superpositions of these
two states, of the form a|0 + b|1, can also exist, in which it is not possible to say that
the qubit is deÔ¨Ånitely in the state |0, or deÔ¨Ånitely in the state |1.
We conclude with some useful terminology which is often used in connection with

the description of quantum states. We say that any linear combination i Œ±i |œài  is a
superposition of the states |œài  with amplitude Œ±i for the state |œài . So, for example,
the state
|0 ‚àí |1
‚àö
2

(2.83)

‚àö
is a superposition
‚àö of the states |0 and |1 with amplitude 1/ 2 for the state |0, and
amplitude ‚àí1/ 2 for the state |1.
2.2.2 Evolution
How does the state, |œà, of a quantum mechanical system change with time? The following
postulate gives a prescription for the description of such state changes.
Postulate 2: The evolution of a closed quantum system is described by a unitary
transformation. That is, the state |œà of the system at time t1 is related to the
state |œà   of the system at time t2 by a unitary operator U which depends only on
the times t1 and t2 ,
|œà   = U |œà .

(2.84)

Just as quantum mechanics does not tell us the state space or quantum state of a
particular quantum system, it does not tell us which unitary operators U describe realworld quantum dynamics. Quantum mechanics merely assures us that the evolution of
any closed quantum system may be described in such a way. An obvious question to ask
is: what unitary operators are natural to consider? In the case of single qubits, it turns
out that any unitary operator at all can be realized in realistic systems.
Let‚Äôs look at a few examples of unitary operators on a single qubit which are important in quantum computation and quantum information. We have already seen several
examples of such unitary operators ‚Äì the Pauli matrices, deÔ¨Åned in Section 2.1.3, and
the quantum gates described in Chapter 1. As remarked in Section 1.3.1, the X matrix is
gate, by analogy to the classical
gate. The X and
often known as the quantum
Z Pauli matrices are also sometimes referred to as the bit Ô¨Çip and phase Ô¨Çip matrices: the
X matrix takes |0 to |1, and |1 to |0, thus earning the name bit Ô¨Çip; and the Z matrix
leaves |0 invariant, and takes |1 to ‚àí|1, with the extra factor of ‚àí1 added known as a
phase factor, thus justifying the term phase Ô¨Çip. We will not use the term phase Ô¨Çip for

82

Introduction to quantum mechanics

Z very often, since it is easily confused with the phase gate to be deÔ¨Åned in Chapter 4.
(Section 2.2.7 contains more discussion of the many uses of the term ‚Äòphase‚Äô.)
Another interesting unitary operator
‚àö is the Hadamard gate,
‚àö which we denote H. This
has the action H|0 ‚â° (|0 + |1)/ 2, H|1 ‚â° (|0 ‚àí |1)/ 2, and corresponding matrix
representation

Exercise 2.51: Verify that the Hadamard gate H is unitary.
Exercise 2.52: Verify that H 2 = I.
Exercise 2.53: What are the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of H?
Postulate 2 requires that the system being described be closed. That is, it is not
interacting in any way with other systems. In reality, of course, all systems (except the
Universe as a whole) interact at least somewhat with other systems. Nevertheless, there
are interesting systems which can be described to a good approximation as being closed,
and which are described by unitary evolution to some good approximation. Furthermore,
at least in principle every open system can be described as part of a larger closed system
(the Universe) which is undergoing unitary evolution. Later, we‚Äôll introduce more tools
which allow us to describe systems which are not closed, but for now we‚Äôll continue with
the description of the evolution of closed systems.
Postulate 2 describes how the quantum states of a closed quantum system at two
different times are related. A more reÔ¨Åned version of this postulate can be given which
describes the evolution of a quantum system in continuous time. From this more reÔ¨Åned
postulate we will recover Postulate 2. Before we state the revised postulate, it is worth
pointing out two things. First, a notational remark. The operator H appearing in the
following discussion is not the same as the Hadamard operator, which we just introduced.
Second, the following postulate makes use of the apparatus of differential equations.
Readers with little background in the study of differential equations should be reassured
that they will not be necessary for much of the book, with the exception of parts of
Chapter 7, on real physical implementations of quantum information processing.
Postulate 2 : The time evolution of the state of a closed quantum system is
described by the SchroÃàdinger equation,
i

d|œà
= H|œà.
dt

(2.86)

In this equation,  is a physical constant known as Planck‚Äôs constant whose value
must be experimentally determined. The exact value is not important to us. In
practice, it is common to absorb the factor  into H, effectively setting  = 1. H
is a Ô¨Åxed Hermitian operator known as the Hamiltonian of the closed system.
If we know the Hamiltonian of a system, then (together with a knowledge of ) we
understand its dynamics completely, at least in principle. In general Ô¨Åguring out the
Hamiltonian needed to describe a particular physical system is a very difÔ¨Åcult problem
‚Äì much of twentieth century physics has been concerned with this problem ‚Äì which
requires substantial input from experiment in order to be answered. From our point of

The postulates of quantum mechanics

83

view this is a problem of detail to be addressed by physical theories built within the
framework of quantum mechanics ‚Äì what Hamiltonian do we need to describe atoms
in such-and-such a conÔ¨Åguration ‚Äì and is not a question that needs to be addressed by
the theory of quantum mechanics itself. Most of the time in our discussion of quantum
computation and quantum information we won‚Äôt need to discuss Hamiltonians, and when
we do, we will usually just posit that some matrix is the Hamiltonian as a starting point,
and proceed from there, without attempting to justify the use of that Hamiltonian.
Because the Hamiltonian is a Hermitian operator it has a spectral decomposition
E|EE|,

H=

(2.87)

E

with eigenvalues E and corresponding normalized eigenvectors |E. The states |E are
conventionally referred to as energy eigenstates, or sometimes as stationary states, and
E is the energy of the state |E. The lowest energy is known as the ground state energy
for the system, and the corresponding energy eigenstate (or eigenspace) is known as the
ground state. The reason the states |E are sometimes known as stationary states is
because their only change in time is to acquire an overall numerical factor,
|E ‚Üí exp(‚àíiEt/)|E.

(2.88)

As an example, suppose a single qubit has Hamiltonian
H = œâX.

(2.89)

In this equation œâ is a parameter that, in practice, needs to be experimentally determined.
We won‚Äôt worry about the parameter overly much here ‚Äì the point is to give you a feel
for the sort of Hamiltonians that are sometimes written down in the study of quantum
computation and quantum information. The energy eigenstates ‚àö
of this Hamiltonian‚àöare
obviously the same as the eigenstates of X, namely (|0 + |1)/ 2 and (|0 ‚àí |1)/‚àö2,
with corresponding energies œâ and ‚àíœâ. The ground state is therefore (|0 ‚àí |1)/ 2,
and the ground state energy is ‚àíœâ.
What is the connection between the Hamiltonian picture of dynamics, Postulate 2 ,
and the unitary operator picture, Postulate 2? The answer is provided by writing down
the solution to SchroÃàdinger‚Äôs equation, which is easily veriÔ¨Åed to be:


‚àíiH(t2 ‚àí t1 )
|œà(t2 ) = exp
|œà(t1 ) = U (t1 , t2 )|œà(t1 ) ,

where we deÔ¨Åne



U (t1 , t2 ) ‚â° exp


‚àíiH(t2 ‚àí t1 )
.


(2.91)

You will show in the exercises that this operator is unitary, and furthermore, that any
unitary operator U can be realized in the form U = exp(iK) for some Hermitian operator
K. There is therefore a one-to-one correspondence between the discrete-time description
of dynamics using unitary operators, and the continuous time description using Hamiltonians. For most of the book we use the unitary formulation of quantum dynamics.
Exercise 2.54: Suppose A and B are commuting Hermitian operators. Prove that
exp(A) exp(B) = exp(A + B). (Hint: Use the results of Section 2.1.9.)

84

Introduction to quantum mechanics

Exercise 2.55: Prove that U (t1 , t2 ) deÔ¨Åned in Equation (2.91) is unitary.
Exercise 2.56: Use the spectral decomposition to show that K ‚â° ‚àíi log(U ) is
Hermitian for any unitary U , and thus U = exp(iK) for some Hermitian K.
In quantum computation and quantum information we often speak of applying a
unitary operator to a particular quantum system. For example, in the context of quantum
circuits we may speak of applying the unitary gate X to a single qubit. Doesn‚Äôt this
contradict what we said earlier, about unitary operators describing the evolution of a
closed quantum system? After all, if we are ‚Äòapplying‚Äô a unitary operator, then that
implies that there is an external ‚Äòwe‚Äô who is interacting with the quantum system, and
the system is not closed.
An example of this occurs when a laser is focused on an atom. After a lot of thought
and hard work it is possible to write down a Hamiltonian describing the total atom‚Äì
laser system. The interesting thing is that when we write down the Hamiltonian for the
atom‚Äìlaser system and consider the effects on the atom alone, the behavior of the state
vector of the atom turns out to be almost but not quite perfectly described by another
Hamiltonian, the atomic Hamiltonian. The atomic Hamiltonian contains terms related
to laser intensity, and other parameters of the laser, which we can vary at will. It is as if
the evolution of the atom were being described by a Hamiltonian which we can vary at
will, despite the atom not being a closed system.
More generally, for many systems like this it turns out to be possible to write down
a time-varying Hamiltonian for a quantum system, in which the Hamiltonian for the
system is not a constant, but varies according to some parameters which are under an
experimentalist‚Äôs control, and which may be changed during the course of an experiment. The system is not, therefore, closed, but it does evolve according to SchroÃàdinger‚Äôs
equation with a time-varying Hamiltonian, to some good approximation.
The upshot is that to begin we will often describe the evolution of quantum systems ‚Äì
even systems which aren‚Äôt closed ‚Äì using unitary operators. The main exception to this,
quantum measurement, will be described in the next section. Later on we will investigate
in more detail possible deviations from unitary evolution due to the interaction with other
systems, and understand more precisely the dynamics of realistic quantum systems.
2.2.3 Quantum measurement
We postulated that closed quantum systems evolve according to unitary evolution. The
evolution of systems which don‚Äôt interact with the rest of the world is all very well, but
there must also be times when the experimentalist and their experimental equipment ‚Äì
an external physical system in other words ‚Äì observes the system to Ô¨Ånd out what is
going on inside the system, an interaction which makes the system no longer closed, and
thus not necessarily subject to unitary evolution. To explain what happens when this
is done, we introduce Postulate 3, which provides a means for describing the effects of
measurements on quantum systems.
Postulate 3: Quantum measurements are described by a collection {Mm } of
measurement operators. These are operators acting on the state space of the
system being measured. The index m refers to the measurement outcomes that
may occur in the experiment. If the state of the quantum system is |œà
immediately before the measurement then the probability that result m occurs is

The measurement operators satisfy the completeness equation,

(2.94)

The completeness equation expresses the fact that probabilities sum to one:
p(m) =

1=

‚Ä†
œà|Mm
Mm |œà .

(2.95)

This equation being satisÔ¨Åed for all |œà is equivalent to the completeness equation.
However, the completeness equation is much easier to check directly, so that‚Äôs why it
appears in the statement of the postulate.
A simple but important example of a measurement is the measurement of a qubit in
the computational basis. This is a measurement on a single qubit with two outcomes
deÔ¨Åned by the two measurement operators M0 = |00|, M1 = |11|. Observe that
each measurement operator is Hermitian, and that M02 = M0 , M12 = M1 . Thus the
completeness relation is obeyed, I = M0‚Ä†M0 + M1‚Ä† M1 = M0 + M1 . Suppose the state
being measured is |œà = a|0 + b|1. Then the probability of obtaining measurement
outcome 0 is
p(0) = œà|M0‚Ä† M0 |œà = œà|M0 |œà = |a|2 .

(2.96)

Similarly, the probability of obtaining the measurement outcome 1 is p(1) = |b|2 . The
state after measurement in the two cases is therefore
M0 |œà
a
=
|0
|a|
|a|
M1 |œà
b
= |1.
|b|
|b|

(2.97)
(2.98)

We will see in Section 2.2.7 that multipliers like a/|a|, which have modulus one, can
effectively be ignored, so the two post-measurement states are effectively |0 and |1, just
as described in Chapter 1.
The status of Postulate 3 as a fundamental postulate intrigues many people. Measuring
devices are quantum mechanical systems, so the quantum system being measured and
the measuring device together are part of a larger, isolated, quantum mechanical system.
(It may be necessary to include quantum systems other than the system being measured
and the measuring device to obtain a completely isolated system, but the point is that
this can be done.) According to Postulate 2, the evolution of this larger isolated system
can be described by a unitary evolution. Might it be possible to derive Postulate 3 as a
consequence of this picture? Despite considerable investigation along these lines there is
still disagreement between physicists about whether or not this is possible. We, however,
are going to take the very pragmatic approach that in practice it is clear when to apply

86

Introduction to quantum mechanics

Postulate 2 and when to apply Postulate 3, and not worry about deriving one postulate
from the other.
Over the next few sections we apply Postulate 3 to several elementary but important
measurement scenarios. Section 2.2.4 examines the problem of distinguishing a set of
quantum states. Section 2.2.5 explains a special case of Postulate 3, the projective or
von Neumann measurements. Section 2.2.6 explains another special case of Postulate 3,
known as POVM measurements. Many introductions to quantum mechanics only discuss
projective measurements, omitting a full discussion of Postulate 3 or of POVM elements.
For this reason we have included Box 2.5 on page 91 which comments on the relationship
between the different classes of measurement we describe.
Exercise 2.57: (Cascaded measurements are single measurements) Suppose
{Ll } and {Mm } are two sets of measurement operators. Show that a
measurement deÔ¨Åned by the measurement operators {Ll } followed by a
measurement deÔ¨Åned by the measurement operators {Mm } is physically
equivalent to a single measurement deÔ¨Åned by measurement operators {Nlm }
with the representation Nlm ‚â° Mm Ll .
2.2.4 Distinguishing quantum states
An important application of Postulate 3 is to the problem of distinguishing quantum
states. In the classical world, distinct states of an object are usually distinguishable, at
least in principle. For example, we can always identify whether a coin has landed heads or
tails, at least in the ideal limit. Quantum mechanically, the situation is more complicated.
In Section 1.6 we gave a plausible argument that non-orthogonal quantum states cannot
be distinguished. With Postulate 3 as a Ô¨Årm foundation we can now give a much more
convincing demonstration of this fact.
Distinguishability, like many ideas in quantum computation and quantum information,
is most easily understood using the metaphor of a game involving two parties, Alice and
Bob. Alice chooses a state |œài  (1 ‚â§ i ‚â§ n) from some Ô¨Åxed set of states known to both
parties. She gives the state |œài  to Bob, whose task it is to identify the index i of the
state Alice has given him.
Suppose the states |œài  are orthonormal. Then Bob can do a quantum measurement
to distinguish these states, using the following procedure. DeÔ¨Åne measurement operators
Mi ‚â° |œài œài |, one for each possible index i, and an additional measurement operator

M0 deÔ¨Åned as the positive square root of the positive operator I ‚àí i = 0 |œài œài |.
These operators satisfy the completeness relation, and if the state |œài  is prepared then
p(i) = œài |Mi |œài  = 1, so the result i occurs with certainty. Thus, it is possible to
reliably distinguish the orthonormal states |œài .
By contrast, if the states |œài  are not orthonormal then we can prove that there is no
quantum measurement capable of distinguishing the states. The idea is that Bob will do
a measurement described by measurement operators Mj , with outcome j. Depending on
the outcome of the measurement Bob tries to guess what the index i was using some rule,
i = f (j), where f (¬∑) represents the rule he uses to make the guess. The key to why Bob
can‚Äôt distinguish non-orthogonal states |œà1  and |œà2  is the observation that |œà2  can be
decomposed into a (non-zero) component parallel to |œà1 , and a component orthogonal
to |œà1 . Suppose j is a measurement outcome such that f (j) = 1, that is, Bob guesses
that the state was |œà1  when he observes j. But because of the component of |œà2  parallel

The postulates of quantum mechanics

87

to |œà1 , there is a non-zero probability of getting outcome j when |œà2  is prepared, so
sometimes Bob will make an error identifying which state was prepared. A more rigorous
argument that non-orthogonal states can‚Äôt be distinguished is given in Box 2.3, but this
captures the essential idea.
Box 2.3: Proof that non-orthogonal states can‚Äôt be reliably distinguished
A proof by contradiction shows that no measurement distinguishing the nonorthogonal states |œà1  and |œà2  is possible. Suppose such a measurement is possible.
If the state |œà1  (|œà2 ) is prepared then the probability of measuring j such that

f (j) = 1 (f (j) = 2) must be 1. DeÔ¨Åning Ei ‚â° j:f (j)=i Mj‚Ä†Mj , these observations
may be written as:
œà1 |E1 |œà1  = 1; œà2 |E2 |œà2  = 1.
(2.99)

Since i Ei = I it follows that i œà1 |E‚àöi |œà1  = 1, and since œà1 |E1 |œà1  = 1
we must have œà1 |E2 |œà1  = 0, and thus E2 |œà1  = 0. Suppose we decompose
|œà2  = Œ±|œà1  + Œ≤|œï, where |œï is orthonormal‚àöto |œà1 , |Œ±|2 ‚àö
+ |Œ≤|2 = 1, and |Œ≤| < 1
since |œà1  and |œà2  are not orthogonal. Then E2 |œà2  = Œ≤ E2 |œï, which implies
a contradiction with (2.99), as


œà2 |E2 |œà2  = |Œ≤|2 œï|E2 |œï ‚â§ |Œ≤|2 < 1,

(2.100)

where the second last inequality follows from the observation that
œï|E2 |œï ‚â§

œï|Ei |œï = œï|œï = 1.

2.2.5 Projective measurements
In this section we explain an important special case of the general measurement postulate,
Postulate 3. This special class of measurements is known as projective measurements.
For many applications of quantum computation and quantum information we will be
concerned primarily with projective measurements. Indeed, projective measurements actually turn out to be equivalent to the general measurement postulate, when they are
augmented with the ability to perform unitary transformations, as described in Postulate 2. We will explain this equivalence in detail in Section 2.2.8, as the statement of the
measurement postulate for projective measurements is superÔ¨Åcially rather different from
the general postulate, Postulate 3.
Projective measurements: A projective measurement is described by an
observable, M , a Hermitian operator on the state space of the system being
observed. The observable has a spectral decomposition,
mPm ,

M=

(2.102)

m

where Pm is the projector onto the eigenspace of M with eigenvalue m. The
possible outcomes of the measurement correspond to the eigenvalues, m, of the
observable. Upon measuring the state |œà, the probability of getting result m is

given by
p(m) = œà|Pm |œà .

(2.103)

Given that outcome m occurred, the state of the quantum system immediately
after the measurement is
P |œà
‚àöm
.
p(m)

(2.104)

Projective measurements can be understood as a special case of Postulate 3. Suppose the
measurement operators in Postulate 3, in addition to satisfying the completeness relation

‚Ä†
m Mm Mm = I, also satisfy the conditions that Mm are orthogonal projectors, that is,
the Mm are Hermitian, and Mm Mm = Œ¥m,m Mm . With these additional restrictions,
Postulate 3 reduces to a projective measurement as just deÔ¨Åned.
Projective measurements have many nice properties. In particular, it is very easy to
calculate average values for projective measurements. By deÔ¨Ånition, the average (see
Appendix 1 for elementary deÔ¨Ånitions and results in probability theory) value of the
measurement is

(2.112)

m

= œà|M |œà.

(2.113)

This is a useful formula, which simpliÔ¨Åes many calculations. The average value of the
observable M is often written M  ‚â° œà|M |œà. From this formula for the average
follows a formula for the standard deviation associated to observations of M ,
[Œî(M )]2 = (M ‚àí M )2 

(2.114)

= M  ‚àí M  .

(2.115)

The standard deviation is a measure of the typical spread of the observed values upon measurement of M . In particular, if we perform a large number of experiments in which the
state |œà is prepared and the observable M is measured, then the
standard deviation Œî(M )
of the observed values is determined by the formula Œî(M ) = M 2  ‚àí M 2 . This formulation of measurement and standard deviations in terms of observables gives rise in
an elegant way to results such as the Heisenberg uncertainty principle (see Box 2.4).
Exercise 2.58: Suppose we prepare a quantum system in an eigenstate |œà of some
observable M , with corresponding eigenvalue m. What is the average observed
value of M , and the standard deviation?
Two widely used nomenclatures for measurements deserve emphasis. Rather than giving an observable to describe a projective measurement, often people simply list a com
plete set of orthogonal projectors Pm satisfying the relations m Pm = I and Pm Pm =

Box 2.4: The Heisenberg uncertainty principle
Perhaps the best known result of quantum mechanics is the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Suppose A and B are two Hermitian operators, and |œà is a
quantum state. Suppose œà|AB|œà = x + iy, where x and y are real. Note that
œà|[A, B]|œà = 2iy and œà|{A, B}|œà = 2x. This implies that
2

2

2

|œà|[A, B]|œà| + |œà|{A, B}|œà| = 4 |œà|AB|œà| .

(2.105)

By the Cauchy‚ÄìSchwarz inequality
2

|œà|AB|œà| ‚â§ œà|A2 |œàœà|B 2 |œà,

(2.106)

which combined with Equation (2.105) and dropping a non-negative term gives
2

|œà|[A, B]|œà| ‚â§ 4œà|A2 |œàœà|B 2 |œà.

(2.107)

Suppose C and D are two observables. Substituting A = C ‚àíC and B = D‚àíD
into the last equation, we obtain Heisenberg‚Äôs uncertainty principle as it is usually
stated:
|œà|[C, D]|œà|
Œî(C)Œî(D) ‚â•
.
(2.108)
2
You should be wary of a common misconception about the uncertainty principle,
that measuring an observable C to some ‚Äòaccuracy‚Äô Œî(C) causes the value of D to
be ‚Äòdisturbed‚Äô by an amount Œî(D) in such a way that some sort of inequality similar
to (2.108) is satisÔ¨Åed. While it is true that measurements in quantum mechanics
cause disturbance to the system being measured, this is most emphatically not the
content of the uncertainty principle.
The correct interpretation of the uncertainty principle is that if we prepare a large
number of quantum systems in identical states, |œà, and then perform measurements
of C on some of those systems, and of D in others, then the standard deviation
Œî(C) of the C results times the standard deviation Œî(D) of the results for D will
satisfy the inequality (2.108).
As an example of the uncertainty principle, consider the observables X and Y
when measured for the quantum state |0. In Equation (2.70) we showed that
[X, Y ] = 2iZ, so the uncertainty principle tells us that
Œî(X)Œî(Y ) ‚â• 0|Z|0 = 1 .

(2.109)

One elementary consequence of this is that Œî(X) and Œî(Y ) must both be strictly
greater than 0, as can be veriÔ¨Åed by direct calculation.

Œ¥mm Pm . The corresponding observable implicit in this usage is M = m mPm . Another widely used phrase, to ‚Äòmeasure in a basis |m‚Äô, where |m form an orthonormal basis, simply means to perform the projective measurement with projectors Pm = |mm|.
Let‚Äôs look at an example of projective measurements on single qubits. First is the
measurement of the observable Z. This has eigenvalues +1 and ‚àí1 with corresponding
eigenvectors‚àö|0 and |1. Thus, for example, measurement of Z on the state |œà =
(|0 + |1)/ 2 gives the result +1 with probability œà|00|œà = 1/2, and similarly the

result ‚àí1 with probability 1/2. More generally, suppose v is any real three-dimensional
unit vector. Then we can deÔ¨Åne an observable:
v ¬∑ œÉ ‚â° v1 œÉ1 + v2 œÉ2 + v3 œÉ3 .

(2.116)

Measurement of this observable is sometimes referred to as a ‚Äòmeasurement of spin along
the v axis‚Äô, for historical reasons. The following two exercises encourage you to work out
some elementary but important properties of such a measurement.
Exercise 2.59: Suppose we have qubit in the state |0, and we measure the observable
X. What is the average value of X? What is the standard deviation of X?
Exercise 2.60: Show that v ¬∑ œÉ has eigenvalues ¬±1, and that the projectors onto the
corresponding eigenspaces are given by P¬± = (I ¬± v ¬∑ œÉ)/2.
Exercise 2.61: Calculate the probability of obtaining the result +1 for a measurement
of v ¬∑ œÉ, given that the state prior to measurement is |0. What is the state of the
system after the measurement if +1 is obtained?

2.2.6 POVM measurements
The quantum measurement postulate, Postulate 3, involves two elements. First, it gives
a rule describing the measurement statistics, that is, the respective probabilities of the
different possible measurement outcomes. Second, it gives a rule describing the postmeasurement state of the system. However, for some applications the post-measurement
state of the system is of little interest, with the main item of interest being the probabilities
of the respective measurement outcomes. This is the case, for example, in an experiment
where the system is measured only once, upon conclusion of the experiment. In such
instances there is a mathematical tool known as the POVM formalism which is especially
well adapted to the analysis of the measurements. (The acronym POVM stands for
‚ÄòPositive Operator-Valued Measure‚Äô, a technical term whose historical origins we won‚Äôt
worry about.) This formalism is a simple consequence of the general description of
measurements introduced in Postulate 3, but the theory of POVMs is so elegant and
widely used that it merits a separate discussion here.
Suppose a measurement described by measurement operators Mm is performed upon
a quantum system in the state |œà. Then the probability of outcome m is given by
‚Ä†
p(m) = œà|Mm
Mm |œà. Suppose we deÔ¨Åne
‚Ä†
Mm .
Em ‚â° Mm

(2.117)

Then from Postulate 3 and elementary linear algebra, Em is a positive operator such

that m Em = I and p(m) = œà|Em |œà. Thus the set of operators Em are sufÔ¨Åcient to
determine the probabilities of the different measurement outcomes. The operators Em
are known as the POVM elements associated with the measurement. The complete set
{Em } is known as a POVM.
As an example of a POVM, consider a projective measurement described by measurement operators Pm , where the Pm are projectors such that Pm Pm = Œ¥mm Pm and

m Pm = I. In this instance (and only this instance) all the POVM elements are the
‚Ä†
Pm = Pm .
same as the measurement operators themselves, since Em ‚â° Pm

The postulates of quantum mechanics

Box 2.5: General measurements, projective measurements, and POVMs
Most introductions to quantum mechanics describe only projective measurements,
and consequently the general description of measurements given in Postulate 3
may be unfamiliar to many physicists, as may the POVM formalism described in
Section 2.2.6. The reason most physicists don‚Äôt learn the general measurement
formalism is because most physical systems can only be measured in a very coarse
manner. In quantum computation and quantum information we aim for an exquisite
level of control over the measurements that may be done, and consequently it helps
to use a more comprehensive formalism for the description of measurements.
Of course, when the other axioms of quantum mechanics are taken into account,
projective measurements augmented by unitary operations turn out to be completely
equivalent to general measurements, as shown in Section 2.2.8. So a physicist
trained in the use of projective measurements might ask to what end we start with
the general formalism, Postulate 3? There are several reasons for doing so. First,
mathematically general measurements are in some sense simpler than projective
measurements, since they involve fewer restrictions on the measurement operators;
there is, for example, no requirement for general measurements analogous to the
condition Pi Pj = Œ¥ij Pi for projective measurements. This simpler structure also
gives rise to many useful properties for general measurements that are not possessed
by projective measurements. Second, it turns out that there are important problems
in quantum computation and quantum information ‚Äì such as the optimal way
to distinguish a set of quantum states ‚Äì the answer to which involves a general
measurement, rather than a projective measurement.
A third reason for preferring Postulate 3 as a starting point is related to a property
of projective measurements known as repeatability. Projective measurements are
repeatable in the sense that if we perform a projective measurement once, and
obtain the outcome m, repeating the measurement gives the outcome m again and
does not change the state. To see this, suppose
|œà
was the initial state. After the
'
( 
Ô¨Årst measurement the state is |œàm  = Pm |œà / œà|Pm |œà. Applying Pm to
|œàm  does not change it, so we have œàm |Pm |œàm  = 1, and therefore repeated
measurement gives the result m each time, without changing the state.
This repeatability of projective measurements tips us off to the fact that many
important measurements in quantum mechanics are not projective measurements.
For instance, if we use a silvered screen to measure the position of a photon we
destroy the photon in the process. This certainly makes it impossible to repeat
the measurement of the photon‚Äôs position! Many other quantum measurements
are also not repeatable in the same sense as a projective measurement. For such
measurements, the general measurement postulate, Postulate 3, must be employed.
Where do POVMs Ô¨Åt in this picture? POVMs are best viewed as a special case
of the general measurement formalism, providing the simplest means by which
one can study general measurement statistics, without the necessity for knowing
the post-measurement state. They are a mathematical convenience that sometimes
gives extra insight into quantum measurements.

Introduction to quantum mechanics

Exercise 2.62: Show that any measurement where the measurement operators and the
POVM elements coincide is a projective measurement.

Above we noticed that the POVM operators are positive and satisfy m Em = I.

Suppose now that {Em } is some arbitrary set of positive operators such that m Em = I.
We will show that there exists a set of measurement operators
Mm deÔ¨Åning a measurement
‚àö

‚Ä†
described by the POVM {Em }. DeÔ¨Åning Mm ‚â° Em we see that m Mm
Mm =

m Em = I, and therefore the set {Mm } describes a measurement with POVM {Em }.
For this reason it is convenient to deÔ¨Åne a POVM to be any set of operators {Em } such

that: (a) each operator Em is positive; and (b) the completeness relation m Em = I is
obeyed, expressing the fact that probabilities sum to one. To complete the description
of POVMs, we note again that given a POVM {Em }, the probability of outcome m is
given by p(m) = œà|Em |œà.
We‚Äôve looked at projective measurements as an example of the use of POVMs, but
it wasn‚Äôt very exciting since we didn‚Äôt learn much that was new. The following more
sophisticated example illustrates the use of the POVM formalism as a guide for our
intuition in quantum computation and quantum information. Suppose
‚àö Alice gives Bob a
qubit prepared in one of two states, |œà1  = |0 or |œà2  = (|0 + |1)/ 2. As explained in
Section 2.2.4 it is impossible for Bob to determine whether he has been given |œà1  or |œà2 
with perfect reliability. However, it is possible for him to perform a measurement which
distinguishes the states some of the time, but never makes an error of mis-identiÔ¨Åcation.
Consider a POVM containing three elements,
‚àö
2
‚àö |11|,
(2.118)
E1 ‚â°
1+ 2
‚àö
2 |0 ‚àí |1 0| ‚àí 1|
‚àö
,
(2.119)
E2 ‚â°
2
1+ 2
E3 ‚â° I ‚àí E1 ‚àí E2 .
(2.120)
It is straightforward to verify that these are positive operators which satisfy the com
pleteness relation m Em = I, and therefore form a legitimate POVM.
Suppose Bob is given the state |œà1  = |0. He performs the measurement described
by the POVM {E1 , E2 , E3 }. There is zero probability that he will observe the result
E1 , since E1 has been cleverly chosen to ensure that œà1 |E1 |œà1  = 0. Therefore, if the
result of his measurement is E1 then Bob can safely conclude that the state he received
must have been |œà2 . A similar line of reasoning shows that if the measurement outcome
E2 occurs then it must have been the state |œà1  that Bob received. Some of the time,
however, Bob will obtain the measurement outcome E3 , and he can infer nothing about
the identity of the state he was given. The key point, however, is that Bob never makes a
mistake identifying the state he has been given. This infallibility comes at the price that
sometimes Bob obtains no information about the identity of the state.
This simple example demonstrates the utility of the POVM formalism as a simple
and intuitive way of gaining insight into quantum measurements in instances where
only the measurement statistics matter. In many instances later in the book we will only
be concerned with measurement statistics, and will therefore use the POVM formalism
rather than the more general formalism for measurements described in Postulate 3.
Exercise 2.63: Suppose a measurement is described by measurement operators Mm .

The postulates of quantum mechanics

93

‚àö
Show that there exist unitary operators Um such that Mm = Um Em , where
Em is the POVM associated to the measurement.
Exercise 2.64: Suppose Bob is given a quantum state chosen from a set |œà1 , . . . , |œàm 
of linearly independent states. Construct a POVM {E1 , E2 , . . . , Em+1 } such that
if outcome Ei occurs, 1 ‚â§ i ‚â§ m, then Bob knows with certainty that he was
given the state |œài . (The POVM must be such that œài |Ei |œài  > 0 for each i.)
2.2.7 Phase
‚ÄòPhase‚Äô is a commonly used term in quantum mechanics, with several different meanings dependent upon context. At this point it is convenient to review a couple of these
meanings. Consider, for example, the state eiŒ∏ |œà, where |œà is a state vector, and Œ∏ is a
real number. We say that the state eiŒ∏ |œà is equal to |œà, up to the global phase factor
eiŒ∏ . It is interesting to note that the statistics of measurement predicted for these two
states are the same. To see this, suppose Mm is a measurement operator associated to
some quantum measurement, and note that the respective probabilities for outcome m
‚Ä†
‚Ä†
‚Ä†
occurring are œà|Mm
Mm |œà and œà|e‚àíiŒ∏ Mm
Mm eiŒ∏ |œà = œà|Mm
Mm |œà. Therefore,
from an observational point of view these two states are identical. For this reason we may
ignore global phase factors as being irrelevant to the observed properties of the physical
system.
There is another kind of phase known as the relative phase, which has quite a different
meaning. Consider the states
|0 + |1
‚àö
2

and

|0 ‚àí |1
‚àö
.
2

(2.121)

‚àö
In the
Ô¨Årst
state
the
amplitude
of
|1
is
1/
2. For the second state the amplitude is
‚àö
‚àí1/ 2. In each case the magnitude of the amplitudes is the same, but they differ in
sign. More generally, we say that two amplitudes, a and b, differ by a relative phase if
there is a real Œ∏ such that a = exp(iŒ∏)b. More generally still, two states are said to differ
by a relative phase in some basis if each of the amplitudes in that basis is related by such
a phase factor. For example, the two states displayed above are the same up to a relative
phase shift because the |0 amplitudes are identical (a relative phase factor of 1), and
the |1 amplitudes differ only by a relative phase factor of ‚àí1. The difference between
relative phase factors and global phase factors is that for relative phase the phase factors
may vary from amplitude to amplitude. This makes the relative phase a basis-dependent
concept unlike global phase. As a result, states which differ only by relative phases in
some basis give rise to physically observable differences in measurement statistics, and
it is not possible to regard these states as physically equivalent, as we do with states
differing by a global phase factor
‚àö
‚àö
Exercise 2.65: Express the states (|0 + |1)/ 2 and (|0 ‚àí |1)/ 2 in a basis in
which they are not the same up to a relative phase shift.
2.2.8 Composite systems
Suppose we are interested in a composite quantum system made up of two (or more)
distinct physical systems. How should we describe states of the composite system? The
following postulate describes how the state space of a composite system is built up from
the state spaces of the component systems.

94

Introduction to quantum mechanics

Postulate 4: The state space of a composite physical system is the tensor product
of the state spaces of the component physical systems. Moreover, if we have
systems numbered 1 through n, and system number i is prepared in the state
|œài , then the joint state of the total system is |œà1  ‚äó |œà2  ‚äó ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ ‚äó |œàn .
Why is the tensor product the mathematical structure used to describe the state space of
a composite physical system? At one level, we can simply accept it as a basic postulate, not
reducible to something more elementary, and move on. After all, we certainly expect that
there be some canonical way of describing composite systems in quantum mechanics.
Is there some other way we can arrive at this postulate? Here is one heuristic that is
sometimes used. Physicists sometimes like to speak of the superposition principle of
quantum mechanics, which states that if |x and |y are two states of a quantum system,
then any superposition Œ±|x + Œ≤|y should also be an allowed state of a quantum system,
where |Œ±|2 + |Œ≤|2 = 1. For composite systems, it seems natural that if |A is a state of
system A, and |B is a state of system B, then there should be some corresponding state,
which we might denote |A|B, of the joint system AB. Applying the superposition
principle to product states of this form, we arrive at the tensor product postulate given
above. This is not a derivation, since we are not taking the superposition principle as a
fundamental part of our description of quantum mechanics, but it gives you the Ô¨Çavor of
the various ways in which these ideas are sometimes reformulated.
A variety of different notations for composite systems appear in the literature. Part of
the reason for this proliferation is that different notations are better adapted for different
applications, and we will also Ô¨Ånd it convenient to introduce some specialized notations
on occasion. At this point it sufÔ¨Åces to mention a useful subscript notation to denote
states and operators on different systems, when it is not clear from context. For example,
in a system containing three qubits, X2 is the Pauli œÉx operator acting on the second
qubit.
Exercise 2.66: Show that the average value of the
‚àö observable X1 Z2 for a two qubit
system measured in the state (|00 + |11)/ 2 is zero.
In Section 2.2.5 we claimed that projective measurements together with unitary dynamics are sufÔ¨Åcient to implement a general measurement. The proof of this statement
makes use of composite quantum systems, and is a nice illustration of Postulate 4 in
action. Suppose we have a quantum system with state space Q, and we want to perform a measurement described by measurement operators Mm on the system Q. To do
this, we introduce an ancilla system, with state space M , having an orthonormal basis
|m in one-to-one correspondence with the possible outcomes of the measurement we
wish to implement. This ancilla system can be regarded as merely a mathematical device
appearing in the construction, or it can be interpreted physically as an extra quantum
system introduced into the problem, which we assume has a state space with the required
properties.
Letting |0 be any Ô¨Åxed state of M , deÔ¨Åne an operator U on products |œà|0 of states
|œà from Q with the state |0 by
Mm |œà|m.

By the results of Exercise 2.67 it follows that U can be extended to a unitary operator on
the space Q ‚äó M , which we also denote by U .
Exercise 2.67: Suppose V is a Hilbert space with a subspace W . Suppose
U : W ‚Üí V is a linear operator which preserves inner products, that is, for any
|w1  and |w2  in W ,
w1 |U ‚Ä† U |w2  = w1 |w2 .

(2.126)

Prove that there exists a unitary operator U  : V ‚Üí V which extends U . That is,
U  |w = U |w for all |w in W , but U  is deÔ¨Åned on the entire space V . Usually
we omit the prime symbol  and just write U to denote the extension.
Next, suppose we perform a projective measurement on the two systems described by
projectors Pm ‚â° IQ ‚äó |mm|. Outcome m occurs with probability

just as prescribed by Postulate 3. Thus unitary dynamics, projective measurements, and
the ability to introduce ancillary systems, together allow any measurement of the form
described in Postulate 3 to be realized.
Postulate 4 also enables us to deÔ¨Åne one of the most interesting and puzzling ideas
associated with composite quantum systems ‚Äì entanglement. Consider the two qubit state
|œà =

|00 + |11
‚àö
.
2

(2.132)

This state has the remarkable property that there are no single qubit states |a and |b
such that |œà = |a|b, a fact which you should now convince yourself of:

96

Introduction to quantum mechanics

Exercise 2.68: Prove that |œà = |a|b for all single qubit states |a and |b.
We say that a state of a composite system having this property (that it can‚Äôt be written
as a product of states of its component systems) is an entangled state. For reasons which
nobody fully understands, entangled states play a crucial role in quantum computation
and quantum information, and arise repeatedly through the remainder of this book. We
have already seen entanglement play a crucial role in quantum teleportation, as described
in Section 1.3.7. In this chapter we give two examples of the strange effects enabled by
entangled quantum states, superdense coding (Section 2.3), and the violation of Bell‚Äôs
inequality (Section 2.6).
2.2.9 Quantum mechanics: a global view
We have now explained all the fundamental postulates of quantum mechanics. Most of
the rest of the book is taken up with deriving consequences of these postulates. Let‚Äôs
quickly review the postulates and try to place them in some kind of global perspective.
Postulate 1 sets the arena for quantum mechanics, by specifying how the state of an
isolated quantum system is to be described. Postulate 2 tells us that the dynamics of
closed quantum systems are described by the SchroÃàdinger equation, and thus by unitary
evolution. Postulate 3 tells us how to extract information from our quantum systems by
giving a prescription for the description of measurement. Postulate 4 tells us how the
state spaces of different quantum systems may be combined to give a description of the
composite system.
What‚Äôs odd about quantum mechanics, at least by our classical lights, is that we can‚Äôt
directly observe the state vector. It‚Äôs a little bit like a game of chess where you can
never Ô¨Ånd out exactly where each piece is, but only know the rank of the board they
are on. Classical physics ‚Äì and our intuition ‚Äì tells us that the fundamental properties
of an object, like energy, position, and velocity, are directly accessible to observation. In
quantum mechanics these quantities no longer appear as fundamental, being replaced by
the state vector, which can‚Äôt be directly observed. It is as though there is a hidden world
in quantum mechanics, which we can only indirectly and imperfectly access. Moreover,
merely observing a classical system does not necessarily change the state of the system.
Imagine how difÔ¨Åcult it would be to play tennis if each time you looked at the ball its
position changed! But according to Postulate 3, observation in quantum mechanics is an
invasive procedure that typically changes the state of the system.
What conclusions should we draw from these strange features of quantum mechanics?
Might it be possible to reformulate quantum mechanics in a mathematically equivalent
way so that it had a structure more like classical physics? In Section 2.6 we‚Äôll prove
Bell‚Äôs inequality, a surprising result that shows any attempt at such a reformulation is
doomed to failure. We‚Äôre stuck with the counter-intuitive nature of quantum mechanics.
Of course, the proper reaction to this is glee, not sorrow! It gives us an opportunity
to develop tools of thought that make quantum mechanics intuitive. Moreover, we can
exploit the hidden nature of the state vector to do information processing tasks beyond
what is possible in the classical world. Without this counter-intuitive behavior, quantum
computation and quantum information would be a lot less interesting.
We can also turn this discussion about, and ask ourselves: ‚ÄòIf quantum mechanics is
so different from classical physics, then how come the everyday world looks so classical?‚Äô
Why do we see no evidence of a hidden state vector in our everyday lives? It turns out

Application: superdense coding

97

that the classical world we see can be derived from quantum mechanics as an approximate
description of the world that will be valid on the sort of time, length and mass scales
we commonly encounter in our everyday lives. Explaining the details of how quantum
mechanics gives rise to classical physics is beyond the scope of this book, but the interested
reader should check out the discussion of this topic in ‚ÄòHistory and further reading‚Äôat
the end of Chapter 8.

2.3 Application: superdense coding
Superdense coding is a simple yet surprising application of elementary quantum mechanics. It combines in a concrete, non-trivial way all the basic ideas of elementary quantum
mechanics, as covered in the previous sections, and is therefore an ideal example of the
information processing tasks that can be accomplished using quantum mechanics.
Superdense coding involves two parties, conventionally known as ‚ÄòAlice‚Äô and ‚ÄòBob‚Äô,
who are a long way away from one another. Their goal is to transmit some classical
information from Alice to Bob. Suppose Alice is in possession of two classical bits of
information which she wishes to send Bob, but is only allowed to send a single qubit to
Bob. Can she achieve her goal?
Superdense coding tells us that the answer to this question is yes. Suppose Alice and
Bob initially share a pair of qubits in the entangled state
|œà =

|00 + |11
‚àö
.
2

(2.133)

Alice is initially in possession of the Ô¨Årst qubit, while Bob has possession of the second
qubit, as illustrated in Figure 2.3. Note that |œà is a Ô¨Åxed state; there is no need for Alice
to have sent Bob any qubits in order to prepare this state. Instead, some third party may
prepare the entangled state ahead of time, sending one of the qubits to Alice, and the
other to Bob.

Figure 2.3. The initial setup for superdense coding, with Alice and Bob each in possession of one half of an
entangled pair of qubits. Alice can use superdense coding to transmit two classical bits of information to Bob, using
only a single qubit of communication and this preshared entanglement.

By sending the single qubit in her possession to Bob, it turns out that Alice can
communicate two bits of classical information to Bob. Here is the procedure she uses. If
she wishes to send the bit string ‚Äò00‚Äô to Bob then she does nothing at all to her qubit. If

As we noted in Section 1.3.6, these four states are known as the Bell basis, Bell states,
or EPR pairs, in honor of several of the pioneers who Ô¨Årst appreciated the novelty of
entanglement. Notice that the Bell states form an orthonormal basis, and can therefore
be distinguished by an appropriate quantum measurement. If Alice sends her qubit to
Bob, giving Bob possession of both qubits, then by doing a measurement in the Bell basis
Bob can determine which of the four possible bit strings Alice sent.
Summarizing, Alice, interacting with only a single qubit, is able to transmit two bits
of information to Bob. Of course, two qubits are involved in the protocol, but Alice
never need interact with the second qubit. Classically, the task Alice accomplishes would
have been impossible had she only transmitted a single classical bit, as we will show
in Chapter 12. Furthermore, this remarkable superdense coding protocol has received
partial veriÔ¨Åcation in the laboratory. (See ‚ÄòHistory and further reading‚Äô for references to
the experimental veriÔ¨Åcation.) In later chapters we will see many other examples, some
of them much more spectacular than superdense coding, of quantum mechanics being
harnessed to perform information processing tasks. However, a key point can already be
seen in this beautiful example: information is physical, and surprising physical theories
such as quantum mechanics may predict surprising information processing abilities.
Exercise 2.69: Verify that the Bell basis forms an orthonormal basis for the two qubit
state space.
Exercise 2.70: Suppose E is any positive operator acting on Alice‚Äôs qubit. Show that
œà|E ‚äó I|œà takes the same value when |œà is any of the four Bell states.
Suppose some malevolent third party (‚ÄòEve‚Äô) intercepts Alice‚Äôs qubit on the way
to Bob in the superdense coding protocol. Can Eve infer anything about which
of the four possible bit strings 00, 01, 10, 11 Alice is trying to send? If so, how, or
if not, why not?

2.4 The density operator
We have formulated quantum mechanics using the language of state vectors. An alternate
formulation is possible using a tool known as the density operator or density matrix.
This alternate formulation is mathematically equivalent to the state vector approach,
but it provides a much more convenient language for thinking about some commonly
encountered scenarios in quantum mechanics. The next three sections describe the density
operator formulation of quantum mechanics. Section 2.4.1 introduces the density operator
using the concept of an ensemble of quantum states. Section 2.4.2 develops some general

properties of the density operator. Finally, Section 2.4.3 describes an application where
the density operator really shines ‚Äì as a tool for the description of individual subsystems
of a composite quantum system.
2.4.1 Ensembles of quantum states
The density operator language provides a convenient means for describing quantum
systems whose state is not completely known. More precisely, suppose a quantum system
is in one of a number of states |œài , where i is an index, with respective probabilities pi .
We shall call {pi , |œài } an ensemble of pure states. The density operator for the system
is deÔ¨Åned by the equation
œÅ‚â°

pi |œài œài |.

(2.138)

i

The density operator is often known as the density matrix; we will use the two terms
interchangeably. It turns out that all the postulates of quantum mechanics can be reformulated in terms of the density operator language. The purpose of this section and
the next is to explain how to perform this reformulation, and explain when it is useful.
Whether one uses the density operator language or the state vector language is a matter of
taste, since both give the same results; however it is sometimes much easier to approach
problems from one point of view rather than the other.
Suppose, for example, that the evolution of a closed quantum system is described by
the unitary operator U . If the system was initially in the state |œài  with probability pi then
after the evolution has occurred the system will be in the state U |œài  with probability
pi . Thus, the evolution of the density operator is described by the equation
U

œÅ=

pi U |œài œài |U ‚Ä† = U œÅU ‚Ä†.

(2.139)

Measurements are also easily described in the density operator language. Suppose we
perform a measurement described by measurement operators Mm . If the initial state was
|œài , then the probability of getting result m is
‚Ä†
‚Ä†
p(m|i) = œài |Mm
Mm |œài  = tr(Mm
Mm |œài œài |),

(2.140)

where we have used Equation (2.61) to obtain the last equality. By the law of total
probability (see Appendix 1 for an explanation of this and other elementary notions of
probability theory) the probability of obtaining result m is
p(m) =

p(m|i)pi

(2.142)

‚Ä†

(2.143)

What is the density operator of the system after obtaining the measurement result m? If
the initial state was |œài  then the state after obtaining the result m is
Mm |œài 
|œàim  = 
.
‚Ä†
œài |Mm
Mm |œài 

(2.144)

100

Thus, after a measurement which yields the result m we have an ensemble of states |œàim 
with respective probabilities p(i|m). The corresponding density operator œÅm is therefore
œÅm =

But by elementary probability theory, p(i|m) = p(m, i)/p(m) = p(m|i)pi /p(m). Substituting from (2.143) and (2.140) we obtain

(2.147)

What we have shown is that the basic postulates of quantum mechanics related to
unitary evolution and measurement can be rephrased in the language of density operators.
In the next section we complete this rephrasing by giving an intrinsic characterization of
the density operator that does not rely on the idea of a state vector.
Before doing so, however, it is useful to introduce some more language, and one more
fact about the density operator. First, the language. A quantum system whose state |œà
is known exactly is said to be in a pure state. In this case the density operator is simply
œÅ = |œàœà|. Otherwise, œÅ is in a mixed state; it is said to be a mixture of the different
pure states in the ensemble for œÅ. In the exercises you will be asked to demonstrate a
simple criterion for determining whether a state is pure or mixed: a pure state satisÔ¨Åes
tr(œÅ2 ) = 1, while a mixed state satisÔ¨Åes tr(œÅ2 ) < 1. A few words of warning about the
nomenclature: sometimes people use the term ‚Äòmixed state‚Äô as a catch-all to include both
pure and mixed quantum states. The origin for this usage seems to be that it implies that
the writer is not necessarily assuming that a state is pure. Second, the term ‚Äòpure state‚Äô
is often used in reference to a state vector |œà, to distinguish it from a density operator
œÅ.
Finally, imagine a quantum system is prepared in the state œÅi with probability pi . It is
not difÔ¨Åcult to convince yourself that the system may be described by the density matrix

i pi œÅi . A proof of this is to suppose that œÅi arises from some ensemble {pij , |œàij }
(note that i is Ô¨Åxed) of pure states, so the probability for being in the state |œàij  is pi pij .
The density matrix for the system is thus
œÅ=

pi pij |œàij œàij |

(2.148)

pi œÅi ,

(2.149)

ij

=
i


where we have used the deÔ¨Ånition œÅi = j pij |œàij œàij |. We say that œÅ is a mixture
of the states œÅi with probabilities pi . This concept of a mixture comes up repeatedly in
the analysis of problems like quantum noise, where the effect of the noise is to introduce
ignorance into our knowledge of the quantum state. A simple example is provided by the
measurement scenario described above. Imagine that, for some reason, our record of the
result m of the measurement was lost. We would have a quantum system in the state
œÅm with probability p(m), but would no longer know the actual value of m. The state of

such a quantum system would therefore be described by the density operator

a nice compact formula which may be used as the starting point for analysis of further
operations on the system.
2.4.2 General properties of the density operator
The density operator was introduced as a means of describing ensembles of quantum
states. In this section we move away from this description to develop an intrinsic characterization of density operators that does not rely on an ensemble interpretation. This
allows us to complete the program of giving a description of quantum mechanics that
does not take as its foundation the state vector. We also take the opportunity to develop
numerous other elementary properties of the density operator.
The class of operators that are density operators are characterized by the following
useful theorem:
Theorem 2.5: (Characterization of density operators) An operator œÅ is the density
operator associated to some ensemble {pi , |œài } if and only if it satisÔ¨Åes the
conditions:
(1) (Trace condition) œÅ has trace equal to one.
(2) (Positivity condition) œÅ is a positive operator.
Proof

Suppose œÅ = i pi |œài œài | is a density operator. Then
pi tr(|œài œài |) =

tr(œÅ) =
i

pi = 1,

(2.153)

i

so the trace condition tr(œÅ) = 1 is satisÔ¨Åed. Suppose |œï is an arbitrary vector in state
space. Then
œï|œÅ|œï =

pi œï|œài œài |œï

(2.154)

pi |œï|œài |2

(2.155)

i

=
i

‚â• 0,

(2.156)

so the positivity condition is satisÔ¨Åed.
Conversely, suppose œÅ is any operator satisfying the trace and positivity conditions.
Since œÅ is positive, it must have a spectral decomposition
œÅ=

Œªj |jj|,

(2.157)

j

where the vectors |j are orthogonal, and Œªj are real, non-negative eigenvalues of œÅ.

102

Introduction to quantum mechanics


From the trace condition we see that j Œªj = 1. Therefore, a system in state |j with
probability Œªj will have density operator œÅ. That is, the ensemble {Œªj , |j} is an ensemble
of states giving rise to the density operator œÅ.

This theorem provides a characterization of density operators that is intrinsic to the
operator itself: we can deÔ¨Åne a density operator to be a positive operator œÅ which has
trace equal to one. Making this deÔ¨Ånition allows us to reformulate the postulates of
quantum mechanics in the density operator picture. For ease of reference we state all the
reformulated postulates here:
Postulate 1: Associated to any isolated physical system is a complex vector space
with inner product (that is, a Hilbert space) known as the state space of the
system. The system is completely described by its density operator, which is a
positive operator œÅ with trace one, acting on the state space of the system. If a
quantum system is in the state œÅi with probability pi , then the density operator for

the system is i pi œÅi .
Postulate 2: The evolution of a closed quantum system is described by a unitary
transformation. That is, the state œÅ of the system at time t1 is related to the state
œÅ of the system at time t2 by a unitary operator U which depends only on the
times t1 and t2 ,
œÅ = U œÅU ‚Ä†.

(2.158)

Postulate 3: Quantum measurements are described by a collection {Mm } of
measurement operators. These are operators acting on the state space of the
system being measured. The index m refers to the measurement outcomes that
may occur in the experiment. If the state of the quantum system is œÅ immediately
before the measurement then the probability that result m occurs is given by
‚Ä†
p(m) = tr(Mm
Mm œÅ),

(2.159)

and the state of the system after the measurement is
‚Ä†
Mm œÅMm

‚Ä†
tr(Mm
Mm œÅ)

.

(2.160)

The measurement operators satisfy the completeness equation,
m

‚Ä†
Mm
Mm = I.

(2.161)

Postulate 4: The state space of a composite physical system is the tensor product
of the state spaces of the component physical systems. Moreover, if we have
systems numbered 1 through n, and system number i is prepared in the state œÅi ,
then the joint state of the total system is œÅ1 ‚äó œÅ2 ‚äó . . . œÅn .
These reformulations of the fundamental postulates of quantum mechanics in terms of
the density operator are, of course, mathematically equivalent to the description in terms
of the state vector. Nevertheless, as a way of thinking about quantum mechanics, the
density operator approach really shines for two applications: the description of quantum
systems whose state is not known, and the description of subsystems of a composite

The density operator

quantum system, as will be described in the next section. For the remainder of this
section we Ô¨Çesh out the properties of the density matrix in more detail.
Exercise 2.71: (Criterion to decide if a state is mixed or pure) Let œÅ be a
density operator. Show that tr(œÅ2 ) ‚â§ 1, with equality if and only if œÅ is a pure
state.
It is a tempting (and surprisingly common) fallacy to suppose that the eigenvalues
and eigenvectors of a density matrix have some special signiÔ¨Åcance with regard to the
ensemble of quantum states represented by that density matrix. For example, one might
suppose that a quantum system with density matrix

œÅ = |00| + |11| .

(2.162)

must be in the state |0 with probability 3/4 and in the state |1 with probability 1/4.
However, this is not necessarily the case. Suppose we deÔ¨Åne

That is, these two different ensembles of quantum states give rise to the same density
matrix. In general, the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of a density matrix just indicate one
of many possible ensembles that may give rise to a speciÔ¨Åc density matrix, and there is
no reason to suppose it is an especially privileged ensemble.
A natural question to ask in the light of this discussion is what class of ensembles does
give rise to a particular density matrix? The solution to this problem, which we now give,
has surprisingly many applications in quantum computation and quantum information,
notably in the understanding of quantum noise and quantum error-correction (Chapters 8
and 10). For the solution it is convenient to make use of vectors |œàÃÉi  which may not be

normalized to unit length. We say the set |œàÃÉi  generates the operator œÅ ‚â° i |œàÃÉi œàÃÉi |,
and thus the connection to the usual ensemble picture of density operators is expressed
‚àö
by the equation |œàÃÉi  = pi |œài . When do two sets of vectors, |œàÃÉi  and |œïÃÉj  generate the
same operator œÅ? The solution to this problem will enable us to answer the question of
what ensembles give rise to a given density matrix.
Theorem 2.6: (Unitary freedom in the ensemble for density matrices) The sets
|œàÃÉi  and |œïÃÉj  generate the same density matrix if and only if
|œàÃÉi  =

uij |œïÃÉj  ,

(2.166)

where uij is a unitary matrix of complex numbers, with indices i and j, and we

104

‚Äòpad‚Äô whichever set of vectors |œàÃÉi  or |œïÃÉj  is smaller with additional vectors 0 so
that the two sets have the same number of elements.


As a consequence of the theorem, note that œÅ = i pi |œài œài | = j qj |œïj œïj | for
normalized states |œài , |œïj  and probability distributions pi and qj if and only if
‚àö
‚àö
pi |œài  =
uij qj |œïj ,
(2.167)

for some unitary matrix uij , and we may pad the smaller ensemble with entries having
probability zero in order to make the two ensembles the same size. Thus, Theorem 2.6
characterizes the freedom in ensembles {pi , |œài } giving rise to a given density matrix œÅ.
Indeed, it is easily checked that our earlier example of a density matrix with two different
decompositions, (2.162), arises as a special case of this general result. Let‚Äôs turn now to
the proof of the theorem.
Proof

Suppose |œàÃÉi  = j uij |œïÃÉj  for some unitary uij . Then

which shows that |œàÃÉi  and |œïÃÉj  generate the same operator.
Conversely, suppose

(2.172)


Let A = k Œªk |kk| be a decomposition for A such that the states |k are orthonormal,
and the‚àö Œªk are strictly positive. Our strategy is to relate the states |œàÃÉi  to the states
|kÃÉ ‚â° Œªk |k, and similarly relate the states |œïÃÉj  to the states |kÃÉ. Combining the two
relations will give the result. Let |œà be any vector orthonormal to the space spanned by
the |kÃÉ, so œà|kÃÉkÃÉ|œà = 0 for all k, and thus we see that

0 = œà|A|œà =

œà|œàÃÉi œàÃÉi |œà =

|œà|œàÃÉi |2 .

(2.173)

Thus œà|œàÃÉi  = 0 for all i and all |œà orthonormal to the space spanned by the |kÃÉ.
It follows that each |œàÃÉi  can be expressed as a linear combination of the |kÃÉ, |œàÃÉi  =


|œàÃÉi  = j uij |œïÃÉj , where u = vw‚Ä† is unitary.
Exercise 2.72: (Bloch sphere for mixed states) The Bloch sphere picture for pure
states of a single qubit was introduced in Section 1.2. This description has an
important generalization to mixed states as follows.
(1) Show that an arbitrary density matrix for a mixed state qubit may be written
as
I + r ¬∑ œÉ
œÅ=

(2.175)

where r is a real three-dimensional vector such that r ‚â§ 1. This vector is
known as the Bloch vector for the state œÅ.
(2) What is the Bloch vector representation for the state œÅ = I/2?
(3) Show that a state œÅ is pure if and only if r = 1.
(4) Show that for pure states the description of the Bloch vector we have given
coincides with that in Section 1.2.
Exercise 2.73: Let œÅ be a density operator. A minimal ensemble for œÅ is an ensemble
{pi , |œài } containing a number of elements equal to the rank of œÅ. Let |œà be
any state in the support of œÅ. (The support of a Hermitian operator A is the
vector space spanned by the eigenvectors of A with non-zero eigenvalues.) Show
that there is a minimal ensemble for œÅ that contains |œà, and moreover that in
any such ensemble |œà must appear with probability
pi =

,
œài |œÅ‚àí1 |œài 

(2.176)

where œÅ‚àí1 is deÔ¨Åned to be the inverse of œÅ, when œÅ is considered as an operator
acting only on the support of œÅ. (This deÔ¨Ånition removes the problem that œÅ may
not have an inverse.)
2.4.3 The reduced density operator
Perhaps the deepest application of the density operator is as a descriptive tool for subsystems of a composite quantum system. Such a description is provided by the reduced
density operator, which is the subject of this section. The reduced density operator is so
useful as to be virtually indispensable in the analysis of composite quantum systems.
Suppose we have physical systems A and B, whose state is described by a density
operator œÅAB . The reduced density operator for system A is deÔ¨Åned by
œÅA ‚â° trB (œÅAB ),

(2.177)

where trB is a map of operators known as the partial trace over system B. The partial
trace is deÔ¨Åned by


trB |a1 a2 | ‚äó |b1 b2 | ‚â° |a1 a2 | tr(|b1 b2 |),
(2.178)
where |a1  and |a2  are any two vectors in the state space of A, and |b1  and |b2  are any
two vectors in the state space of B. The trace operation appearing on the right hand side

106

Introduction to quantum mechanics

is the usual trace operation for system B, so tr(|b1 b2 |) = b2 |b1 . We have deÔ¨Åned the
partial trace operation only on a special subclass of operators on AB; the speciÔ¨Åcation is
completed by requiring in addition to Equation (2.178) that the partial trace be linear in
its input.
It is not obvious that the reduced density operator for system A is in any sense a
description for the state of system A. The physical justiÔ¨Åcation for making this identiÔ¨Åcation is that the reduced density operator provides the correct measurement statistics for
measurements made on system A. This is explained in more detail in Box 2.6 on page 107.
The following simple example calculations may also help understand the reduced density
operator. First, suppose a quantum system is in the product state œÅAB = œÅ ‚äó œÉ, where
œÅ is a density operator for system A, and œÉ is a density operator for system B. Then
œÅA = trB (œÅ ‚äó œÉ) = œÅ tr(œÉ) = œÅ,

(2.184)

B

which is the result we intuitively expect.
‚àö Similarly, œÅ = œÉ for this state. A less trivial
example is the Bell state (|00 + |11)/ 2. This has density operator

Tracing out the second qubit, we Ô¨Ånd the reduced density operator of the Ô¨Årst qubit,
œÅ1 = tr2 (œÅ)

Notice that this state is a mixed state, since tr((I/2)2 ) = 1/2 < 1. This is quite a
remarkable result. The state of the joint system of two qubits is a pure state, that is,
it is known exactly; however, the Ô¨Årst qubit is in a mixed state, that is, a state about
which we apparently do not have maximal knowledge. This strange property, that the
joint state of a system can be completely known, yet a subsystem be in mixed states, is
another hallmark of quantum entanglement.
Exercise 2.74: Suppose a composite of systems A and B is in the state |a|b, where
|a is a pure state of system A, and |b is a pure state of system B. Show that
the reduced density operator of system A alone is a pure state.
Exercise 2.75: For each of the four Bell states, Ô¨Ånd the reduced density operator for
each qubit.
Quantum teleportation and the reduced density operator
A useful application of the reduced density operator is to the analysis of quantum teleportation. Recall from Section 1.3.7 that quantum teleportation is a procedure for sending

Box 2.6: Why the partial trace?
Why is the partial trace used to describe part of a larger quantum system? The
reason for doing this is because the partial trace operation is the unique operation
which gives rise to the correct description of observable quantities for subsystems
of a composite system, in the following sense.
Suppose M is any observable on system A, and we have some measuring device
which is capable of realizing measurements of M . Let MÃÉ denote the corresponding
observable for the same measurement, performed on the composite system AB.
Our immediate goal is to argue that MÃÉ is necessarily equal to M ‚äó IB . Note that
if the system AB is prepared in the state |m|œà, where |m is an eigenstate of M
with eigenvalue m, and |œà is any state of B, then the measuring device must yield
the result m for the measurement, with probability one. Thus, if Pm is the projector
onto the m eigenspace of the observable M , then the corresponding projector for
MÃÉ is Pm ‚äó IB . We therefore have
MÃÉ =

mPm ‚äó IB = M ‚äó IB .

(2.179)

m

The next step is to show that the partial trace procedure gives the correct measurement statistics for observations on part of a system. Suppose we perform a
measurement on system A described by the observable M . Physical consistency
requires that any prescription for associating a ‚Äòstate‚Äô, œÅA , to system A, must have
the property that measurement averages be the same whether computed via œÅA or
œÅAB ,
tr(M œÅA ) = tr(MÃÉ œÅAB ) = tr((M ‚äó IB )œÅAB ).

(2.180)

This equation is certainly satisÔ¨Åed if we choose œÅA ‚â° trB (œÅAB ). In fact, the partial
trace turns out to be the unique function having this property. To see this uniqueness property, let f (¬∑) be any map of density operators on AB to density operators
on A such that
tr(M f (œÅAB )) = tr((M ‚äó IB )œÅAB ),

(2.181)

for all observables M . Let Mi be an orthonormal basis of operators for the space of
Hermitian operators with respect to the Hilbert‚ÄìSchmidt inner product (X, Y ) ‚â°
tr(XY ) (compare Exercise 2.39 on page 76). Then expanding f (œÅAB ) in this basis
gives
f (œÅAB ) =

Mi tr(Mi f (œÅAB ))

(2.182)

Mi tr((Mi ‚äó IB )œÅAB ).

It follows that f is uniquely determined by Equation (2.180). Moreover, the partial

Introduction to quantum mechanics

At Ô¨Årst sight it appears as though teleportation can be used to do faster than light
communication, a big no-no according to the theory of relativity. We surmised in Section 1.3.7 that what prevents faster than light communication is the need for Alice to
communicate her measurement result to Bob. The reduced density operator allows us to
make this rigorous.
Recall that immediately before Alice makes her measurement the quantum state of the
three qubits is (Equation (1.32)):
1
|00 Œ±|0 + Œ≤|1 + |01 Œ±|1 + Œ≤|0
|œà2  =
2
+|10 Œ±|0 ‚àí Œ≤|1 + |11 Œ±|1 ‚àí Œ≤|0 .
(2.192)
Measuring in Alice‚Äôs computational basis, the state of the system after the measurement
is:

1
|00 Œ±|0 + Œ≤|1 with probability
(2.193)

The density operator of the system is thus

(2.197)
Tracing out Alice‚Äôs system, we see that the reduced density operator of Bob‚Äôs system is
1
œÅB = (Œ±|0 + Œ≤|1)(Œ±‚àó 0| + Œ≤ ‚àó 1|) + (Œ±|1 + Œ≤|0)(Œ±‚àó 1| + Œ≤ ‚àó 0|)

where we have used the completeness relation in the last line. Thus, the state of Bob‚Äôs
system after Alice has performed the measurement but before Bob has learned the measurement result is I/2. This state has no dependence upon the state |œà being teleported,
and thus any measurements performed by Bob will contain no information about |œà,
thus preventing Alice from using teleportation to transmit information to Bob faster than
light.

The Schmidt decomposition and puriÔ¨Åcations

2.5 The Schmidt decomposition and puriÔ¨Åcations
Density operators and the partial trace are just the beginning of a wide array of tools
useful for the study of composite quantum systems, which are at the heart of quantum computation and quantum information. Two additional tools of great value are the
Schmidt decomposition and puriÔ¨Åcations. In this section we present both these tools,
and try to give the Ô¨Çavor of their power.
Theorem 2.7: (Schmidt decomposition) Suppose |œà is a pure state of a composite
system, AB. Then there exist orthonormal states |iA  for system A, and
orthonormal states |iB  of system B such that
|œà =

Œªi |iA |iB ,
i

where Œªi are non-negative real numbers satisfying
co-efÔ¨Åcients.

(2.202)

i

Œª2i = 1 known as Schmidt

This result is very useful. As a taste of its power, consider the following consequence:
let |œà be a pure state of a composite system, AB. Then by the Schmidt decomposition


œÅA = i Œª2i |iA iA | and œÅB = i Œª2i |iB iB |, so the eigenvalues of œÅA and œÅB are
identical, namely Œª2i for both density operators. Many important properties of quantum
systems are completely determined by the eigenvalues of the reduced density operator of
the system, so for a pure state of a composite system such properties will be the same‚àöfor
both systems. As an example, consider the state of two qubits, (|00 + |01 + |11)/ 3.
This has no obvious symmetry property, yet if you calculate tr (œÅA )2 and tr (œÅB )2
you will discover that they have the same value, 7/9 in each case. This is but one small
consequence of the Schmidt decomposition.
Proof
We give the proof for the case where systems A and B have state spaces of the same
dimension, and leave the general case to Exercise 2.76. Let |j and |k be any Ô¨Åxed
orthonormal bases for systems A and B, respectively. Then |œà can be written
ajk |j|k,

|œà =

(2.203)

jk

for some matrix a of complex numbers ajk . By the singular value decomposition, a = udv,
where d is a diagonal matrix with non-negative elements, and u and v are unitary matrices.
Thus
uji dii vik |j|k.

Œªi |iA |iB .

It is easy to check that |iA  forms an orthonormal set, from the unitarity of u and the
orthonormality of |j, and similarly that the |iB  form an orthonormal set.

Introduction to quantum mechanics

Exercise 2.76: Extend the proof of the Schmidt decomposition to the case where A
and B may have state spaces of different dimensionality.
Exercise 2.77: Suppose ABC is a three component quantum system. Show by
example that there are quantum states |œà of such systems which can not be
written in the form
|œà =

Œªi |iA |iB |iC ,

(2.206)

i

where Œªi are real numbers, and |iA , |iB , |iC  are orthonormal bases of the
respective systems.
The bases |iA  and |iB  are called the Schmidt bases for A and B, respectively, and
the number of non-zero values Œªi is called the Schmidt number for the state |œà. The
Schmidt number is an important property of a composite quantum system, which in
some sense quantiÔ¨Åes the ‚Äòamount‚Äô of entanglement between systems A and B. To get
some idea of why this is the case, consider the following obvious but important property:
the Schmidt number is preserved under unitary transformations on system A or system

B alone. To see this, notice that if i Œªi |iA |iB  is the Schmidt decomposition for |œà

then i Œªi (U |iA )|iB  is the Schmidt decomposition for U |œà, where U is a unitary
operator acting on system A alone. Algebraic invariance properties of this type make the
Schmidt number a very useful tool.
Exercise 2.78: Prove that a state |œà of a composite system AB is a product state if
and only if it has Schmidt number 1. Prove that |œà is a product state if and only
if œÅA (and thus œÅB ) are pure states.
A second, related technique for quantum computation and quantum information is
puriÔ¨Åcation. Suppose we are given a state œÅA of a quantum system A. It is possible to
introduce another system, which we denote R, and deÔ¨Åne a pure state |AR for the joint
system AR such that œÅA = trR (|ARAR|). That is, the pure state |AR reduces to œÅA
when we look at system A alone. This is a purely mathematical procedure, known as
puriÔ¨Åcation, which allows us to associate pure states with mixed states. For this reason
we call system R a reference system: it is a Ô¨Åctitious system, without a direct physical
signiÔ¨Åcance.
To prove that puriÔ¨Åcation can be done for any state, we explain how to construct
a system R and puriÔ¨Åcation |AR for œÅA . Suppose œÅA has orthonormal decomposition

œÅA = i pi |iA iA |. To purify œÅA we introduce a system R which has the same state
space as system A, with orthonormal basis states |iR , and deÔ¨Åne a pure state for the
combined system
‚àö A R
|AR ‚â°
pi |i |i .
(2.207)
i

We now calculate the reduced density operator for system A corresponding to the state
|AR:
‚àö
trR (|ARAR|) =
pi pj |iA j A | tr(|iR j R |)
(2.208)

111

(2.210)
(2.211)

Thus |AR is a puriÔ¨Åcation of œÅA .
Notice the close relationship of the Schmidt decomposition to puriÔ¨Åcation: the procedure used to purify a mixed state of system A is to deÔ¨Åne a pure state whose Schmidt
basis for system A is just the basis in which the mixed state is diagonal, with the Schmidt
coefÔ¨Åcients being the square root of the eigenvalues of the density operator being puriÔ¨Åed.
In this section we‚Äôve explained two tools for studying composite quantum systems, the
Schmidt decomposition and puriÔ¨Åcations. These tools will be indispensable to the study of
quantum computation and quantum information, especially quantum information, which
is the subject of Part III of this book.
Exercise 2.79: Consider a composite system consisting of two qubits. Find the
Schmidt decompositions of the states

Exercise 2.80: Suppose |œà and |œï are two pure states of a composite quantum
system with components A and B, with identical Schmidt coefÔ¨Åcients. Show
that there are unitary transformations U on system A and V on system B such
that |œà = (U ‚äó V )|œï.
Exercise 2.81: (Freedom in puriÔ¨Åcations) Let |AR1  and |AR2  be two
puriÔ¨Åcations of a state œÅA to a composite system AR. Prove that there exists a
unitary transformation UR acting on system R such that
|AR1  = (IA ‚äó UR )|AR2 .
Exercise 2.82: Suppose {pi , |œài } is an ensemble of states generating a density matrix

œÅ = i pi |œài œài | for a quantum system A. Introduce a system R with
orthonormal basis |i.

(2) Suppose we measure R in the basis |i, obtaining outcome i. With what
probability do we obtain the result i, and what is the corresponding state of
system A?
(3) Let |AR be any puriÔ¨Åcation of œÅ to the system AR. Show that there exists
an orthonormal basis |i in which R can be measured such that the
corresponding post-measurement state for system A is |œài  with probability
pi .

I recall that during one walk Einstein suddenly stopped, turned to me and asked
whether I really believed that the moon exists only when I look at it. The rest

This chapter has focused on introducing the tools and mathematics of quantum mechanics. As these techniques are applied in the following chapters of this book, an important
recurring theme is the unusual, non-classical properties of quantum mechanics. But
what exactly is the difference between quantum mechanics and the classical world? Understanding this difference is vital in learning how to perform information processing
tasks that are difÔ¨Åcult or impossible with classical physics. This section concludes the
chapter with a discussion of the Bell inequality, a compelling example of an essential
difference between quantum and classical physics.
When we speak of an object such as a person or a book, we assume that the physical
properties of that object have an existence independent of observation. That is, measurements merely act to reveal such physical properties. For example, a tennis ball has as one
of its physical properties its position, which we typically measure using light scattered
from the surface of the ball. As quantum mechanics was being developed in the 1920s
and 1930s a strange point of view arose that differs markedly from the classical view. As
described earlier in the chapter, according to quantum mechanics, an unobserved particle
does not possess physical properties that exist independent of observation. Rather, such
physical properties arise as a consequence of measurements performed upon the system.
For example, according to quantum mechanics a qubit does not possess deÔ¨Ånite properties of ‚Äòspin in the z direction, œÉz ‚Äô, and ‚Äòspin in the x direction, œÉx ‚Äô, each of which can
be revealed by performing the appropriate measurement. Rather, quantum mechanics
gives a set of rules which specify, given the state vector, the probabilities for the possible
measurement outcomes when the observable œÉz is measured, or when the observable œÉx
is measured.
Many physicists rejected this new view of Nature. The most prominent objector was
Albert Einstein. In the famous ‚ÄòEPR paper‚Äô, co-authored with Nathan Rosen and Boris
Podolsky, Einstein proposed a thought experiment which, he believed, demonstrated that
quantum mechanics is not a complete theory of Nature.
The essence of the EPR argument is as follows. EPR were interested in what they
termed ‚Äòelements of reality‚Äô. Their belief was that any such element of reality must be
represented in any complete physical theory. The goal of the argument was to show that
quantum mechanics is not a complete physical theory, by identifying elements of reality
that were not included in quantum mechanics. The way they attempted to do this was
by introducing what they claimed was a sufÔ¨Åcient condition for a physical property to

EPR and the Bell inequality

113

be an element of reality, namely, that it be possible to predict with certainty the value
that property will have, immediately before measurement.
Box 2.7: Anti-correlations in the EPR experiment
Suppose we prepare the two qubit state
|œà =

|01 ‚àí |10
‚àö
,
2

(2.213)

a state sometimes known as the spin singlet for historical reasons. It is not difÔ¨Åcult
to show that this state is an entangled state of the two qubit system. Suppose we
perform a measurement of spin along the v axis on both qubits, that is, we measure
the observable v ¬∑ œÉ (deÔ¨Åned in Equation (2.116) on page 90) on each qubit, getting
a result of +1 or ‚àí1 for each qubit. It turns out that no matter what choice of v
we make, the results of the two measurements are always opposite to one another.
That is, if the measurement on the Ô¨Årst qubit yields +1, then the measurement on
the second qubit will yield ‚àí1, and vice versa. It is as though the second qubit
knows the result of the measurement on the Ô¨Årst, no matter how the Ô¨Årst qubit is
measured. To see why this is true, suppose |a and |b are the eigenstates of v ¬∑ œÉ.
Then there exist complex numbers Œ±, Œ≤, Œ≥, Œ¥ such that
|0 = Œ±|a + Œ≤|b

(2.214)

|1 = Œ≥|a + Œ¥|b.

up to an unobservable global phase factor. As a result, if a measurement of v ¬∑ œÉ
is performed on both qubits, then we can see that a result of +1 (‚àí1) on the Ô¨Årst
qubit implies a result of ‚àí1 (+1) on the second qubit.

Consider, for example, an entangled pair of qubits belonging to Alice and Bob, respectively:
|01 ‚àí |10
‚àö
.
2

(2.218)

Suppose Alice and Bob are a long way away from one another. Alice performs a measurement of spin along the v axis, that is, she measures the observable v ¬∑ œÉ (deÔ¨Åned in
Equation (2.116) on page 90). Suppose Alice receives the result +1. Then a simple quantum mechanical calculation, given in Box 2.7, shows that she can predict with certainty

114

Introduction to quantum mechanics

that Bob will measure ‚àí1 on his qubit if he also measures spin along the v axis. Similarly,
if Alice measured ‚àí1, then she can predict with certainty that Bob will measure +1 on
his qubit. Because it is always possible for Alice to predict the value of the measurement
result recorded when Bob‚Äôs qubit is measured in the v direction, that physical property
must correspond to an element of reality, by the EPR criterion, and should be represented in any complete physical theory. However, standard quantum mechanics, as we
have presented it, merely tells one how to calculate the probabilities of the respective
measurement outcomes if v ¬∑ œÉ is measured. Standard quantum mechanics certainly does
not include any fundamental element intended to represent the value of v ¬∑ œÉ, for all unit
vectors v.
The goal of EPR was to show that quantum mechanics is incomplete, by demonstrating
that quantum mechanics lacked some essential ‚Äòelement of reality‚Äô, by their criterion. They
hoped to force a return to a more classical view of the world, one in which systems could
be ascribed properties which existed independently of measurements performed on those
systems. Unfortunately for EPR, most physicists did not accept the above reasoning as
convincing. The attempt to impose on Nature by Ô¨Åat properties which she must obey
seems a most peculiar way of studying her laws.
Indeed, Nature has had the last laugh on EPR. Nearly thirty years after the EPR paper
was published, an experimental test was proposed that could be used to check whether
or not the picture of the world which EPR were hoping to force a return to is valid or not.
It turns out that Nature experimentally invalidates that point of view, while agreeing
with quantum mechanics.
The key to this experimental invalidation is a result known as Bell‚Äôs inequality. Bell‚Äôs
inequality is not a result about quantum mechanics, so the Ô¨Årst thing we need to do is
momentarily forget all our knowledge of quantum mechanics. To obtain Bell‚Äôs inequality,
we‚Äôre going to do a thought experiment, which we will analyze using our common sense
notions of how the world works ‚Äì the sort of notions Einstein and his collaborators thought
Nature ought to obey. After we have done the common sense analysis, we will perform a
quantum mechanical analysis which we can show is not consistent with the common sense
analysis. Nature can then be asked, by means of a real experiment, to decide between
our common sense notions of how the world works, and quantum mechanics.
Imagine we perform the following experiment, illustrated in Figure 2.4. Charlie prepares two particles. It doesn‚Äôt matter how he prepares the particles, just that he is capable
of repeating the experimental procedure which he uses. Once he has performed the preparation, he sends one particle to Alice, and the second particle to Bob.
Once Alice receives her particle, she performs a measurement on it. Imagine that she
has available two different measurement apparatuses, so she could choose to do one of
two different measurements. These measurements are of physical properties which we
shall label PQ and PR , respectively. Alice doesn‚Äôt know in advance which measurement
she will choose to perform. Rather, when she receives the particle she Ô¨Çips a coin or
uses some other random method to decide which measurement to perform. We suppose
for simplicity that the measurements can each have one of two outcomes, +1 or ‚àí1.
Suppose Alice‚Äôs particle has a value Q for the property PQ . Q is assumed to be an
objective property of Alice‚Äôs particle, which is merely revealed by the measurement,
much as we imagine the position of a tennis ball to be revealed by the particles of light
being scattered off it. Similarly, let R denote the value revealed by a measurement of the
property PR .

EPR and the Bell inequality

115

Similarly, suppose that Bob is capable of measuring one of two properties, PS or PT ,
once again revealing an objectively existing value S or T for the property, each taking
value +1 or ‚àí1. Bob does not decide beforehand which property he will measure, but
waits until he has received the particle and then chooses randomly. The timing of the
experiment is arranged so that Alice and Bob do their measurements at the same time
(or, to use the more precise language of relativity, in a causally disconnected manner).
Therefore, the measurement which Alice performs cannot disturb the result of Bob‚Äôs
measurement (or vice versa), since physical inÔ¨Çuences cannot propagate faster than light.

Figure 2.4. Schematic experimental setup for the Bell inequalities. Alice can choose to measure either Q or R, and
Bob chooses to measure either S or T . They perform their measurements simultaneously. Alice and Bob are
assumed to be far enough apart that performing a measurement on one system can not have any effect on the result
of measurements on the other.

We are going to do some simple algebra with the quantity QS + RS + RT ‚àí QT .
Notice that
QS + RS + RT ‚àí QT = (Q + R)S + (R ‚àí Q)T.

(2.219)

Because R, Q = ¬±1 it follows that either (Q + R)S = 0 or (R ‚àí Q)T = 0. In either
case, it is easy to see from (2.219) that QS + RS + RT ‚àí QT = ¬±2. Suppose next that
p(q, r, s, t) is the probability that, before the measurements are performed, the system is
in a state where Q = q, R = r, S = s, and T = t. These probabilities may depend on
how Charlie performs his preparation, and on experimental noise. Letting E(¬∑) denote
the mean value of a quantity, we have
E(QS + RS + RT ‚àí QT ) =

Introduction to quantum mechanics

This result is also often known as the CHSH inequality after the initials of its four
discoverers. It is part of a larger set of inequalities known generically as Bell inequalities,
since the Ô¨Årst was found by John Bell.
By repeating the experiment many times, Alice and Bob can determine each quantity on
the left hand side of the Bell inequality. For example, after Ô¨Ånishing a set of experiments,
Alice and Bob get together to analyze their data. They look at all the experiments where
Alice measured PQ and Bob measured PS . By multiplying the results of their experiments
together, they get a sample of values for QS. By averaging over this sample, they can
estimate E(QS) to an accuracy only limited by the number of experiments which they
perform. Similarly, they can estimate all the other quantities on the left hand side of the
Bell inequality, and thus check to see whether it is obeyed in a real experiment.
It‚Äôs time to put some quantum mechanics back in the picture. Imagine we perform the
following quantum mechanical experiment. Charlie prepares a quantum system of two
qubits in the state
|œà =

|01 ‚àí |10
‚àö
.

(2.226)

He passes the Ô¨Årst qubit to Alice, and the second qubit to Bob. They perform measurements of the following observables:
Q = Z1
R = X1

‚àö

Z 2 ‚àí X2
T = ‚àö

(2.227)
(2.228)

Simple calculations show that the average values for these observables, written in the
quantum mechanical ¬∑ notation, are:
1

QS = ‚àö ; RS = ‚àö ; RT  = ‚àö ; QT  = ‚àí ‚àö .

Thus,

‚àö
QS + RS + RT  ‚àí QT  = 2 2.

(2.229)

(2.230)

Hold on! We learned back in (2.225) that the average value of QS plus the average value
of RS plus the average value of RT minus the average value of QT can never

two. Yet here, quantum mechanics predicts that this sum of averages yields 2 2!
Fortunately, we can ask Nature to resolve the apparent paradox for us. Clever experiments using photons ‚Äì particles of light ‚Äì have been done to check the prediction (2.230)
of quantum mechanics versus the Bell inequality (2.225) which we were led to by our
common sense reasoning. The details of the experiments are outside the scope of the
book, but the results were resoundingly in favor of the quantum mechanical prediction.
The Bell inequality (2.225) is not obeyed by Nature.
What does this mean? It means that one or more of the assumptions that went into
the derivation of the Bell inequality must be incorrect. Vast tomes have been written
analyzing the various forms in which this type of argument can be made, and analyzing
the subtly different assumptions which must be made to reach Bell-like inequalities. Here
we merely summarize the main points.
There are two assumptions made in the proof of (2.225) which are questionable:

(1) The assumption that the physical properties PQ , PR , PS , PT have deÔ¨Ånite values
Q, R, S, T which exist independent of observation. This is sometimes known as the
assumption of realism.
(2) The assumption that Alice performing her measurement does not inÔ¨Çuence the
result of Bob‚Äôs measurement. This is sometimes known as the assumption of
locality.
These two assumptions together are known as the assumptions of local realism. They are
certainly intuitively plausible assumptions about how the world works, and they Ô¨Åt our
everyday experience. Yet the Bell inequalities show that at least one of these assumptions
is not correct.
What can we learn from Bell‚Äôs inequality? For physicists, the most important lesson
is that their deeply held commonsense intuitions about how the world works are wrong.
The world is not locally realistic. Most physicists take the point of view that it is the
assumption of realism which needs to be dropped from our worldview in quantum mechanics, although others have argued that the assumption of locality should be dropped
instead. Regardless, Bell‚Äôs inequality together with substantial experimental evidence now
points to the conclusion that either or both of locality and realism must be dropped from
our view of the world if we are to develop a good intuitive understanding of quantum
mechanics.
What lessons can the Ô¨Åelds of quantum computation and quantum information learn
from Bell‚Äôs inequality? Historically the most useful lesson has perhaps also been the most
vague: there is something profoundly ‚Äòup‚Äô with entangled states like the EPR state. A lot
of mileage in quantum computation and, especially, quantum information, has come from
asking the simple question: ‚Äòwhat would some entanglement buy me in this problem?‚Äô
As we saw in teleportation and superdense coding, and as we will see repeatedly later
in the book, by throwing some entanglement into a problem we open up a new world
of possibilities unimaginable with classical information. The bigger picture is that Bell‚Äôs
inequality teaches us that entanglement is a fundamentally new resource in the world that
goes essentially beyond classical resources; iron to the classical world‚Äôs bronze age. A major
task of quantum computation and quantum information is to exploit this new resource to
do information processing tasks impossible or much more difÔ¨Åcult with classical resources.
Problem 2.1: (Functions of the Pauli matrices) Let f (¬∑) be any function from

Problem 2.2: (Properties of the Schmidt number) Suppose |œà is a pure state of
a composite system with components A and B.
(1) Prove that the Schmidt number of |œà is equal to the rank of the reduced
density matrix œÅA ‚â° trB (|œàœà|). (Note that the rank of a Hermitian
operator is equal to the dimension of its support.)

(2) Suppose |œà = j |Œ±j |Œ≤j  is a representation for |œà, where |Œ±j  and |Œ≤j 
are (un-normalized) states for systems A and B, respectively. Prove that the

Problem 2.3: (Tsirelson‚Äôs inequality) Suppose
Q = q ¬∑ œÉ, R = r ¬∑ œÉ, S = s ¬∑ œÉ, T = t ¬∑ œÉ, where q, r, s and t are real unit vectors
in three dimensions. Show that
(Q ‚äó S + R ‚äó S + R ‚äó T ‚àí Q ‚äó T )2 = 4I + [Q, R] ‚äó [S, T ].

Use this result to prove that

so the violation of the Bell inequality found in Equation (2.230) is the maximum
possible in quantum mechanics.

History and further reading
There are an enormous number of books on linear algebra at levels ranging from High
School through to Graduate School. Perhaps our favorites are the two volume set by
Horn and Johnson[HJ85, HJ91], which cover an extensive range of topics in an accessible
manner. Other useful references include Marcus and Minc[MM92], and Bhatia[Bha97]. Good
introductions to linear algebra include Halmos[Hal58], Perlis[Per52], and Strang[Str76].
There are many excellent books on quantum mechanics. Unfortunately, most of
these books focus on topics of tangential interest to quantum information and computation. Perhaps the most relevant in the existing literature is Peres‚Äô superb book[Per93].
Beside an extremely clear exposition of elementary quantum mechanics, Peres gives
an extensive discussion of the Bell inequalities and related results. Good introductory
level texts include Sakurai‚Äôs book[Sak95], Volume III of the superb series by Feynman,
Leighton, and Sands[FLS65a], and the two volume work by Cohen-Tannoudji, Diu and
LaloeÃà[CTDL77a, CTDL77b]. All three of these works are somewhat closer in spirit to quantum computation and quantum information than are most other quantum mechanics
texts, although the great bulk of each is still taken up by applications far removed from
quantum computation and quantum information. As a result, none of these texts need
be read in detail by someone interested in learning about quantum computation and
quantum information. However, any one of these texts may prove handy as a reference,
especially when reading articles by physicists. References for the history of quantum
mechanics may be found at the end of Chapter 1.
Many texts on quantum mechanics deal only with projective measurements. For applications to quantum computing and quantum information it is more convenient ‚Äì and,
we believe, easier for novices ‚Äì to start with the general description of measurements,
of which projective measurements can be regarded as a special case. Of course, ultimately, as we have shown, the two approaches are equivalent. The theory of generalized
measurements which we have employed was developed between the 1940s and 1970s.
Much of the history can be distilled from the book of Kraus[Kra83]. Interesting discussion of quantum measurements may be found in Section 2.2 of Gardiner[Gar91], and in
the book by Braginsky and Khahili[BK92]. The POVM measurement for distinguishing

History and further reading

non-orthogonal states described in Section 2.2.6 is due to Peres[Per88]. The extension
described in Exercise 2.64 appeared in Duan and Guo[DG98].
Superdense coding was invented by Bennett and Wiesner[BW92]. An experiment implementing a variant of superdense coding using entangled photon pairs was performed
by Mattle, Weinfurter, Kwiat, and Zeilinger[MWKZ96].
The density operator formalism was introduced independently by Landau[Lan27] and
by von Neumann[von27]. The unitary freedom in the ensemble for density matrices, Theorem 2.6, was Ô¨Årst pointed out by SchrodÃàinger[Sch36], and was later rediscovered and
extended by Jaynes[Jay57] and by Hughston, Jozsa and Wootters[HJW93]. The result of Exercise 2.73 is from the paper by Jaynes, and the results of Exercises 2.81 and 2.82 appear
in the paper by Hughston, Jozsa and Wootters. The class of probability distributions
which may appear in a density matrix decomposition for a given density matrix has been
studied by Uhlmann[Uhl70] and by Nielsen[Nie99b]. Schmidt‚Äôs eponymous decomposition
appeared in[Sch06]. The result of Exercise 2.77 was noted by Peres[Per95].
The EPR thought experiment is due to Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen[EPR35], and
was recast in essentially the form we have given here by Bohm[Boh51]. It is sometimes
misleadingly referred to as the EPR ‚Äòparadox‚Äô. The Bell inequality is named in honour
of Bell[Bel64], who Ô¨Årst derived inequalities of this type. The form we have presented is
due to Clauser, Horne, Shimony, and Holt[CHSH69], and is often known as the CHSH
inequality. This inequality was derived independently by Bell, who did not publish the
result.
Part 3 of Problem 2.2 is due to Thapliyal (private communication). Tsirelson‚Äôs inequality is due to Tsirelson[Tsi80].
